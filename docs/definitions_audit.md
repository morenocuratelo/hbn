# Definitions Audit
This file checks whether `doc_texts.js` contains text matching each `definitions` entry from `data.js`.

## Price vs Value
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **False**
- Definition snippet: Price is the objective market amount. Subjective Value is the perceived utility encoded in the vmPFC/OFC as a common currency.

## Allais Paradox
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Violates the independence axiom of EUT. Reveals the Certainty Effect: people overweight certain gains (100%) in a non-linear fashion.

## Ultimatum Game
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Responders reject unfair offers (<20%) to punish norm violations. Rejection correlates with anterior insula activation (disgust/negative affect).

## Loss Aversion
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: The value function is steeper for losses: losses hurt more than equivalent gains please (lambda ≈ 2.25).

## Reflection Effect
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **False**
- Definition snippet: Risk seeking to avoid a sure loss versus risk aversion to secure a sure gain.

## Dopamine (DA)
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Reward prediction error and incentive salience ("wanting"). Facilitates the basal ganglia direct (Go) pathway.

## Serotonin (5-HT)
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **False**
- Definition snippet: Cost evaluation and patience. Counterbalances dopamine, modulating the temporal horizon.

## NAcc Role
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Motivation-action interface. Activated by gain anticipation (Knutson) and motivational salience.

## Enriched Environments
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Sensory/motor/social stimulation. Delays motor symptom onset in Huntington models (van Dellen) via BDNF pathways.

## Google Effect
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Sparrow et al.: Digital transactive memory prioritises remembering "where" to retrieve information rather than "what" it is.

## Transactive Memory
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Externalisation of memory on digital media, lowering internal load yet fragmenting learning.

## Musicians
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Auditory and motor cortices expand according to age of practice onset (Elbert).

## Mathematicians
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Increased density in the inferior parietal lobe (Aydin).

## Placebo Effect
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Positive therapeutic outcome driven by psychosocial context (expectation/conditioning), not by the active principle.

## Nocebo Effect
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Adverse outcome driven by negative expectations or anxiety, often mediated by cholecystokinin (CCK).

## Gold Standard
- Present in `doc_texts.js`: **True**
- Definition snippet: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs), double-blind, placebo-controlled.
