    decision making? What happens in the brain? What is the role of the
    ventral temporal cortex? And what about dlPFC? Is causality proven?
    How?

-   How do dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic signals modulate
    the value representations computed in the orbitofrontal cortex, and
    in what ways do these modulatory effects shape the routing of
    information toward the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices during
    decision-making?

-   In what ways can the amygdala and hippocampus reshape the dorsal
    flow of information across prefrontal regions, and how do these
    limbic influences alter premotor and parietal planning processes,
    affecting the selection and execution of behaviour?

-   Considering the contribution of cortico--basal ganglia loops,
    explain how these circuits interact with the sensory → OFC → PFC →
    premotor/parietal pathway to refine behavioural choice among
    competing alternatives, and discuss how a dysregulated dopaminergic
    system would disrupt this integrated architecture.

    lesions to healthy control groups help us understand the functions
    of the damaged brain regions?

    placebo and nocebo effects engage different neurochemical systems
    (opioid, cannabinoid, and CCK), and how can pharmacological blockers
    reveal the specific pathways involved in placebo-induced analgesia
    or nocebo-induced hyperalgesia?
