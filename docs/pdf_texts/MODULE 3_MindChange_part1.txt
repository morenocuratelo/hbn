Change of the World: from 3D to 2D
This change seems different from previous changes (car, electricity, TV) 
for different reasons: 
1) This change is different of its pervasiveness.
2) The shift from technology as a means to its being an end in and of 
itself

Pervasiveness
• In 2011, 71 percent of adult U.S. Internet users bought goods online, and 
the following year a comparable number, 87 percent, of U.K. adults ages 
twenty-five to forty-four were shopping online.
• By 2017, online sales are projected to account for 10 percent of all retail 
sales in the United States.
• U.S. Internet users spend 22.5 percent of their online time on social
networking sites or blogs.
• More than a third of couples who married between 2005 and 2012 in the 
United States reported meeting their spouse online, with about half of 
these meeting through online dating sites and the rest through other 
online sites such as social networking sites and virtual worlds.

• Study on US adults using social networking sites
• 24% of U.S. adult users of social networking sites reported a curious 
phenomenon in 2012—that they missed out on a key event or 
moment in their lives because they were so absorbed in updating 
their social networking site about that event or moment.

Digital Native vs Digital Immigrants
• Digital Native: “someone defined by his or her perceived outlook and 
abilities, based on an automatic facility and familiarity with digital 
technologies”
• Digital Immigrants: “have adopted many aspects of the technology, 
but just like those who learn another language later in life, retain an 
‘accent’ because we still have one foot in the past”
Prensky, 2001.

---PAGE---

Digital Native vs Digital Immigrants
• Digital Native: the date of birth of the Digital Native seems therefore 
to be uncertain
✓back as the 1960s when the term “computer” entered into common language
✓late 1990 when emails became reality
• Digital Immigrants: “have adopted many aspects of the technology, 
but just like those who learn another language later in life, retain an 
‘accent’ because we still have one foot in the past”

Brain Changes
One leading expert in brain development, 
Bryan Kolb, sums up: “Anything that changes 
your brain, changes who you will be. Your 
brain is produced not just by your genes; it’s 
sculpted by a lifetime of experiences. 
Experience alters brain activity, which 
changes gene expression. Any behavioral 
changes you see reflect alterations in the 
brain. The opposite is also true: behavior can 
change the brain.”
Kolb, B. (2009).

Training dogs and birds
• Changes in the brain as a result of experience were actually first 
shown as long ago as 1783 by the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet and 
the Michele Vincenzo Malacarne
• They discovered that training dogs and birds led to an increase in the 
number of folds in a part of the brain (the cerebellum), compared to 
dog littermates or birds from the same clutch of eggs

Visual Plasticity
• In the first years of life the brain has windows of opportunity, 
characterized by the exuberant growth of connections between neurons, 
which allows for astonishing possibilities.
• E.g. in infants the visual and auditory compartments of the cortex appear 
to be functionally interchangeable, equally effectively stimulated by either 
hearing or vision.
• Consequently, when there is a loss of vision in early childhood, some form 
of hearing ends up sharper through a process known as cortical 
remapping. Because the visual sector is not being used for its normal job, it 
adapts to whatever inputs are available and takes on an alternative role, 
helping the brain process hearing with a resulting greater prowess.

Musicians
• Musicians who play string instruments exercise their left hands more than 
their right and, in these players, the section of cortex related to touch is 
accordingly larger for the left hand than the right (right cortex, left hand).
• Study design: 
• Nine musicians (six violinists, two cellists, and one guitarist) who had played their 
instruments for a mean period of 11.7 years (range, 7 to 17 years) served as subjects 
for this study.
• Six non-musicians served as controls.
• During the experimental session, somatosensory stimulation was delivered to the 
first digit and, in separate runs, to the fifth digit of either hand.

Musicians
• Anatomical scans of professional musicians (keyboard players), 
amateur musicians, and nonmusicians showed size differences in a 
range of structures: motor, auditory, and visuo-spatial brain regions
• It’s worth noting that there are strong relationships between 
musician status and practice intensity, suggesting the anatomical 
differences are linked to learning and not to a predisposition to music.

Training in Math
• Normal human subjects with no particular skill or talent are trained 
from scratch in some standardized experimental tasks
• The training to acquire or practicing to perform a skill, which may lead 
to structural changes in the brain, is called experience-dependent 
structural plasticity.
• The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the 
presence of experience-dependent structural plasticity in 
mathematicians’ brains

Training in juggling
• Subjects underwent daily training for three months to learn a three-
ball juggling task, where perception and anticipation were key to 
determining upcoming movements accurately. 
• Scans were performed before training, after three months of 
training, and then after another three months in which no juggling
was attempted, by which time performance had deteriorated back to 
baseline: use it or you will lose it.
• Changes in gray matter after training.

• Scans after training →the juggler 
group demonstrated a bilateral 
expansion in grey matter in the 
mid-temporal area and in the left 
posterior intraparietal sulcus
• This expansion decreased in the 
third scan
→learning-induced cortical

Studies of enriched environments
• The earliest demonstration of the impact of the outside world was with 
what was eventually to be called an “enriched” environment and dates 
back to the 1940s
• Hebb took some of his lab rats home!! Home rats →superior problem 
solving compared to Lab rats.
• Mark Rosenzweig and his team at the University of California in 1964, 
mentioned for the first time the term “environmental enrichment”- They 
demonstrated for the first time physical changes in neural circuits through 
experience

Studies of enriched environments
The study conclusively demonstrated that mice living in such a stimulating environment
developed movement problems much later and with a far more modest degree of impairment.

Different “Selves”
True Self: notion introduced by Carl 
Rogers (1951). The true self is based on 
existing characteristics that need not 
necessarily be fully expressed in normal 
social life, perhaps because there are not 
necessarily occasions when they’ll be 
manifest; rather, they are imagined as 
particular reactions in hypothetical 
situations.
 The picture of Dorian Gray
Real (life) self: the conformed 
individual who is constrained by 
social norms in face-to-face 
interactions
True Self on Internet: concept developed by John Bargh and coworkers (2001). It refers to an individual’s tendency to express the 
“real” aspects of the self through anonymous Internet communication rather than face-to-face communication. The idea is that 
the Internet provides individuals with a unique opportunity for self-expression that encourages people to reveal their true self.
Based on different psychological theories and studies on self, we can argue that we have not only one self but different selves,
used in different conditions and contexts

---PAGE---

Different “Selves”
• Social networking has now resulted in a new self: the hoped-for, 
possible self displayed on social networking sites.
• Individual's possible selves are thought to be the cognitive link 
between past experiences and future hopes, desires, fears, and 
fantasies. 
• They represent what we hope to become as well as what we hope to 
avoid becoming; we call these hoped for and feared selves, 
respectively.

Which self do you share?
Kidscape, a British charity that helps prevent bullying and protects children, 
conducted a survey in which they assessed young people’s cyberlives through an 
online questionnaire.
• N=230 
• Age: 11-18 (from England, Scotland, and Wales)
• Results: one in two (50%) say they lie about their personal details on the Internet.
• Results: the one in eight young people who speak to strangers online are the 
most likely not to tell the truth, with 60% lying about their age and 40 % about 
their personal relationships
• Results: that young people start to change their identities and to act differently 
online at just eleven years of age; create identities that allow them to be more 
rude, more sexy, more adventurous; and generally indulge in inappropriate 
behavior

ROI:
1) Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) →crucial role 
in decisional processes and consolidation of 
long term memory
2) Central precuneus (CP) (medio-parietal region) 
→episodic memory, visuo-spatial imagination, 
consciousness, self-thinking and meditation

Need to share, need to be approved
• Attention and approval from adults are among the strongest rewards 
we experience as we are growing up.
• Infants need a meaningful relationship with a caring and involved 
adult in order to survive and grow. Astonishingly, human growth 
hormone is thought to be released in proportion to the amount of 
caring attention a child receives.
• When we aren’t met with positive feedback, we no longer feel safe 
and protected. And over time we become conditioned to crave 
approval not just from our parents but from others as well

---PAGE---

Need to share, need to be approved…
• The importance of such recognition does not diminish with age. 
Unlike the real world, Twitter and Facebook can always be relied on to 
provide an almost instant response to even your adult demands for 
attention.
• This in turn may explain why the obsessive social networker relies on 
the illusion of cyber-intimacy, despite the inevitable price of a loss of 
privacy.

---PAGE---

…despite the loss of privacy
• Many of us take privacy for granted until we feel it is being invaded
• Privacy appears to be a less prized commodity among the younger 
generation of Digital Natives: nearly half of teenagers have given out 
personal information to someone they don’t know, including photos 
and physical descriptions. 
• Meanwhile, over half of young people send out group messages to 
more than 510 “friends” at a time (the number of Facebook friends 
an average youth has),42 fully aware that each of these contacts 
could then pass on that information to their network of hundreds 
more

• As a species, we seem to have such a craving for self-disclosure that it

personal information on a basic 
biochemical level.

Fig. 1. Two examples of stimuli presented during the imaging paradigm. 
Participants saw innocuous photos of adolescents or everyday objects

behavior (e.g., the marijuana cigarette on the right) or adolescents 
engaging in risky behaviors. Images appeared as they would have in the 
Instagram app on a smartphone in the year 2014: The number of likes was 
displayed underneath each photo next to a heart icon, and the Instagram 
menu buttons were displayed beneath the likes. Finally, there were two 
buttons allowing participants to like an image (“
 Like”) or to move on 
without liking the image (“→Next”).

Third result:
When viewing images depicting risk-
taking (vs. non-risky photographs), high 
school students, but not college students, 
showed decreased activation of neural 
regions implicated in cognitive control.
Figure 3. Differences in decreased activation for comparison of risky and neutral photographs
When viewing Instagram photographs depicting risk-taking activities, compared to 
photographs depicting non-risky, neutral activities, only high-school students showed a 
significant decrease in activity in frontal regions including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
(dmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The high school and college 
samples differed significantly in the dmPFC and left dlPFC, depicted in green.

Conclusions
• Quantifiable Social Endorsement (QSE) plays a significant role in 
influencing how young adults perceive and respond to information on 
social media; in other words, QSE is a mechanism of peer influence, 
and a potential means by which individuals learn about their social 
environment, in a wider age-range than previously shown. 
• These findings make intuitive sense given the continuing importance 
of the peer context in emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000) and the 
popularity of mobile social media among college students

---PAGE---

Conclusions
• While the present study focused specifically on peer influence, it is possible 
that non-peers (e.g., older adults, parents, etc.) might have a similar effect, 
in line with work suggesting overlapping mechanisms between peer and 
parental influence.
• Increased age was associated with greater NAcc response to having one’s 
own content Liked by peers in the high school but not college sample. This 
finding is consistent with recent longitudinal work in adolescents 
demonstrating that NAcc sensitivity to rewarding stimuli increases in 
adolescence and peaks around age 16–17.
• Social reward may progress along a similar trajectory as monetary reward.

Dopamine effect
• If social networking is rewarding and exciting, it is very likely that 
social networking might serve as another trigger for the release of 
dopamine in the brain.
• Specific features of Facebook and other social networking sites 
might make them triggers for dopamine release

Effects of the digital world on relationship
• In 1987, according to one estimate, we spent on average 6 hours per 
day in face-to-face social interaction, and 4 via electronic media. 
• In 2007 the proportion had reversed, with almost 8 hours a day spent 
socializing via electronic media, and only 2,5 hours in face-to-face 
social interaction

• In the United States, 80 percent of online teens ages twelve to seventeen 
use social networking sites, mostly Facebook and MySpace.
• U.S. users have on average 262 friends, a figure higher than the world 
average of roughly 140 friends.
• Twelve-to twenty-four-year-old Facebook users have, on average, more 
than five hundred Facebook friends. Roughly, 22 percent are from high 
school, 12 percent are immediate family, 10 percent are co-workers, 9 
percent are from college, and 10 percent of friends have never been met in 
person or only been met once

people they could really talk to, with the number of available 
confidants down by about a third. 
• Even more alarming, the proportion of those having no one at all with 
whom they could discuss important matters had nearly tripled

Do social networking map directly onto the 
physical brain?
The size of an individual’s online social network 
is closely linked to certain aspects of physical 
brain structures implicated in social cognition.
Kanai et al. found that variation in the number of 
friends on Facebook strongly and significantly 
predicted the size of certain brain structures.

Changes in communication style
• In 2012, the British communications watchdog Ofcom produced its ninth 
annual Communications Market Report.
• The average person was now sending fifty texts a week
• A staggering 96 percent of young people ages sixteen to twenty-four were 
using instant message (non-oral) communication—email, text message, or 
a social network—every day to contact friends and family. Meanwhile, 
verbal communication over the phone or in person has become 
correspondingly less popular, with only 63 percent talking face-to-face with 
friends or family daily

Reduction of face-to-face interactions and 
empaty
• Possible trend: an increase in online relationships and a decrease in 
empathy
• Beyond empathy, excessive Internet use could lead more generally to 
a reduced ability to communicate effectively, as it has been 
associated with a lack of emotional intelligence, including poor 
performance in interpreting facial expressions. 
• Perhaps it is unsurprising that people who spend excessive amounts 
of time on the Internet have deficits in face processing

---PAGE---

Face processing is 
compromised 
Excessive Internet use is associated with a limited ability to 
communicate effectively socially, which depends largely on the capacity 
for perception of the human face. 
Authors used a passive visual detection paradigm to compare the early 
stages of the processing of face-related information in young excessive 
Internet users (EIUs) and healthy normal subjects by analyzing event-
related potentials (ERPs) elicited by faces and by nonface stimuli 
(tables), each presented in the upright and inverted position.

peak amplitude (B), and 
normalized values of the 
N170 face effect in EIUs and 
normal control groups (C).
The P1 and N170 components of the spectrum of ERPs elicited at occipital–temporal sites by the viewing of faces were 
larger and peaked sooner than the same ERP components elicited by tables, and inverted faces significantly enhanced and 
delayed the N170 component. This meant that the faces had more significance for the average observer than the objects. 
EIUs had a generally smaller P1 component than did normal subjects, whether elicited by faces or by tables, and the N170 
effect, or difference in amplitude of the N170 component for faces versus tables, was significantly smaller in the EIUs than in 
normal subjects.

• This impairment could be similar to the impairment of autistic people.
• In the United Kingdom alone, more than half a million people—
around 1 percent of the population—have a form of autism. Autism 
spectrum disorders are characterized by a triad of impairments:
1. difficulty with social communication, both verbal and nonverbal, such that 
patients often find it hard to “read” other people; 
2. difficulty recognizing or understanding other people’s emotions and 
feelings, as well as expressing their own; and 
3. difficulty with social imagination, namely, understanding and predicting 
other people’s behavior, making sense of abstract ideas, and imagining 
situations outside their immediate daily routine.

• Is there a connection between autistic-like traits and the use of social 
networking?
• Two crucial aspects:
1. autistic people are generally most comfortable in cyberspace: in such a 
world, there is no need to understand what might be going on inside the 
minds of others—what you see is what you get
2. different learning screen-based approaches improve autistic people: 
design programs in which peers can explore and improve social and 
communicative skills through interacting and collaborating with virtual 
characters (agents) and digital objects

Nacc and

reputation
• The processing of gains in reputation (positive social feedback related to 
one’s character) occurs in the ventral striatum.
• Furthermore, discovering that others like us, or have provided general 
positive feedback about us, is also processed in the ventral striatum.
• The ventral striatum, which includes the nucleus accumbens, has been 
well-established in the processing of other rewards which motivate human 
behavior, such as money or food.

• In today’s world, we can obtain a good reputation in a variety of ways; for 
example, we can be polite to people or behave in a moral manner. We can 
also manage our reputation online via social media websites.
• Aim of the study: authors employed Facebook use as a proxy for a real-
world behavior aimed at obtaining a good reputation. 
• Then, authors selected participants for their Facebook use and, in the scan, 
participants received gains in reputations, observed the gains in 
reputations of another person or received money.

Results:
• Lower volumes of the nucleus accumbens were associated with 
higher frequency of Facebook checking in everyday life. 
• There were also associations between accumbens volume and 
Facebook duration. 
• Facebook duration, however, was less reliable than Facebook 
frequency over the five weeks period.

---PAGE---

Role of Nacc
Results:
• Given the cross-sectional design of the present study, it remains to be 
elucidated whether lower volumes of the accumbens constitute a 
factor for increased social media use or whether it results as a 
consequence of higher usage. 
• Interestingly, one recent longitudinal study has identified lower NAcc
volumes as risk factors for alcohol use onset in a community sample 
of adolescents

---PAGE---

Role of Nacc
Results:
• In sum, this study gives additional evidence that a) the nucleus accumbens
could be involved in online social media usage and b) that high frequency 
of Facebook checking could be characterized by addictive behavior when 
future work will be able to extend these findings to more excessive users in 
the future. The present investigated sample clearly represents rather 
normal Facebook users 
• As a consequence the present study gives insights into the biological 
underpinnings of daily Facebook usage in a mostly student population and 
the here proposed connections to addictive behavior need to be 
considered as preliminary at best.
