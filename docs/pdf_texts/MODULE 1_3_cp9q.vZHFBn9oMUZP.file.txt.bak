A Sketch of the Relevant Circuitry
• Thinking, planning, and deciding draw on a suite of related mental 
activities that are loosely described under the rubric of executive 
functions
• Although this term alludes to managing corporate activities, it would 
be wrong to imagine that the brain actually works this way. It seems 
more apt to consider executive functions as part of a control system 
(a term borrowed from engineering) that adapts cognitive functions 
to the current environment and state of the organism
• Because several anatomical areas in the prefrontal cortex have been 
linked to these functions, it is tempting to conclude that each of these 
elements maps directly onto a specific brain region.

---PAGE---

A Sketch of the Relevant Circuitry
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the portion of the frontal lobe 
anterior to the motor cortex in both humans and non-human 
primates, and it is especially prominent in humans. 


---PAGE---

A Sketch of the Relevant Circuitry
• No agreement on the histological 
boundaries defining subregions of PFC
• Not clearly defined electrophysiological 
properties of these reagions
• Impossible to identify the flow of 
information through the PFC: connections 
between different cortical regions are 
often reciprocal, and it is hard to 
differentiate which connections are 
feedback and which are feedforward.

---PAGE---

A Sketch of the Relevant Circuitry
Despite this complexity, a rough path from input to output can 
be identified
1. Information about sensory stimuli is conveyed to the 
orbitofrontal cortex, where representations of the values of 
various options may be represented
2. Value signals the flow rostrally and laterally to the lateral 
and medial PFC, where information that influences decision 
making comes into play
3. Than, resulting signal flow dorsally to other PFC regions 
that use this information to plan possible responses
4. Finally, information propagate to premotor and parietal
cortices and finally to the motor and other cortical regions 
that give rise to behavior (behavior is not limited to motor 
actions but also includes perception, attention, emotion, 
memory, and more)

Nucleus accumbens
(NAcc) – ventral

Nucleus accumbens
NAcc gets information from:
1) Hippocampus (region related to memory)
2) Prefrontal cortex (region  involved into the 
higher order decision processes)
3) Amigdala (region related to motivation and 
cost of our decisions)
4) Ventral tegmental area (reward prediction and 
Salience)

---PAGE---

Nucleus accumbens
(NAcc) – ventral 
striatum
• The authors recorded the 
impulse activity of single 
neurons in monkeys that were 
trained in two behavioral 
tasks employing, respectively, 
self-initiated and externally 
timed movements
• When the monkey touches 
reward spikes produced by the 
NA appear
• When the monkey touches an 
object, there is no reward and 
no activation of the NAcc

---PAGE---

NAcc codes for reward 
and prediction of reward
• Animals learn not only about 
stimuli that predict reward but 
also about those that signal the 
omission of an expected reward
• The authors trained 2 monkeys 
in a discrimination task in which 
they had to recognize:
A: a visual stimulus that predicted 
reward (conditioned excitor)
AX:  a stimulus that predicted the 
omission of reward (conditioned 
inhibitor)
Conditioned stimulus Conditioned stimulus

NAcc codes for values
• In this study, authors used a parametric 
monetary incentive delay (MID) task. 
• N = 12 healthy volunteers participated in 
fMRI scans while playing the MID task.
• Subjects see a cue  
• Then, after a delay, a white square appears.
• If subjects press the bottom in time →
collects the reward
More lines more money

---PAGE---

NAcc codes for values
• Activity of the nucleus accumbens is 
proportional to the anticipated gain
• It is less active when person expects to get 
$1, and is even less active when person 
expects to get $0
• Activity of the ventral striatum is 
proportional to the anticipated gain
• Activity of the ventral striatum is higher 
during the anticipation phase (compared 
to the outcome phase)


---PAGE---

Expected utility
• AIM: Anticipated reward magnitude and 
probability comprise dual components of 
expected value (EV), a cornerstone of 
economic and psychological theory. However, 
the neural mechanisms that compute EV have 
not been characterized. 
• Using event-related functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, authors examined neural 
activation as subjects anticipated monetary 
gains and losses that varied in magnitude and 
probability.

the white square is presented
• In this case: high probability and high

---PAGE---

Expected utility

---PAGE---

Expected utility
• The cortical mesial 
prefrontal cortex 
(MPFC) is additionally 
activated according to 
anticipated gain 
probability
• MPFC activation 
correlated with 
probability estimates
These findings suggest that mesolimbic brain regions support the 
computation of EU in an ascending and distributed manner: whereas 
subcortical regions represent an affective component, cortical regions also 
represent a probabilistic component, and, furthermore, may act as integrators

• fMRI and a guessing task in two 
cohorts of 22 and 24 participants
• Participants have to predict the 
location of a red card
a) Participants can turn 4 cards 
→they can correctly predict the 
location of the red card (high 
probability)
b) Participants can turn 1 card 
→they have to guess the 
location (low probability)

---PAGE---

Expected utility
• Activity of nucleus accumbens
is proportional to the expected 
magnitude of the reward.
• NAcc is strongly activated when 
subject is expecting to get 
higher reward. 
• NAcc reacts to the probability 
of the outcome (high activity 
when participants expected 
reward with higher probability).


---PAGE---

Role of NAcc: it calculates expected utility
• According to the neuroeconomics model: subjective value (utility) is 
the averaged firing rate of neurons in specific brain regions. These 
neurons code behavioral preferences.
• Specific brain regions →NAcc
• NAcc activity codes valence and it is proportional to anticipated gain 
magnitude.
• Nacc has neurons that are sensitive to probability 

---PAGE---

Nacc in the “real” world
• The above mentioned studies considered “experimental conditions”
• How about the role of Nacc in more practical conditions. Does it 
reproduce our decision making processes when we have to buy 
something?

---PAGE---

Role of 
NAcc
• Microeconomic theory maintains that 
purchases are driven by a combination of 
consumer preference and price. Using event-
related fMRI, we investigated how people 
weigh these factors to make purchasing 
decisions.
• N = 26
• Subjects were paid $20.00 per hour for 
participating and also received $20.00 in cash 
to spend on products during each of the two 
sessions.
• To ensure subjects’ engagement in the SHOP 
task, one trial was randomly selected after 
each scanning session to count ‘‘for real’.’ If 
subjects had chosen to purchase the product 
presented during the randomly selected trial, 
they paid the price that they had seen in the 
scanner from their $20.00 endowment and 
were shipped the product within two weeks. 
If not, subjects kept their $20.00 
endowment.

---PAGE---

Role of 
NAcc
• Question:
Can we predict participant’s decision 
to buy or not the product (“read” 
his/her mind) during the preference 
phase”?
• Answer: Yes. 
The activity of the NAcc is higher 
when the participant buys the 
product


---PAGE---

Role of NAcc
• Product preference activated the 
nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
• Excessive prices activated the 
insula and deactivated the mesial 
prefrontal cortex (MPFC) prior to 
the purchase decision.
• Activity from each of these regions 
independently predicted 
immediately subsequent purchases 
above and beyond self-report 
variables. 
• These findings suggest that 
activation of distinct neural 
circuits related to anticipatory 
affect precedes and supports 
consumers’ purchasing decisions.


---PAGE---

Role of NAcc
• In this study, the authors investigated 
preferences to different types of products
• It has been shown recently that reward
mechanisms are involved in the regulation 
of social relations like dominance and 
social rank. 
• Based on evolutionary considerations we 
hypothesized that sportscars in contrast to 
other categories of cars, e.g. limousines 
and small cars, are strong social 
reinforcers and would modulate the 
dopaminergic reward circuitry.
• N = 20 healthy male subjects were studied 
with fMRI while viewing photographs of 
different car classes followed by an 
attractivity rating.


---PAGE---

Role of NAcc
• Behaviorally sports cars were rated 
significantly more attractive than 
limousines and small cars


---PAGE---

Role of NAcc
• fMRI results revealed significantly more 
activation in ventral striatum, 
orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate 
and occipital regions for sports cars in 
contrast to other categories of cars.
• Dopamine system and NAcc are involved 
into the valuation process of decision-
making.


---PAGE---

Valuation based on different utilities
• Valuation process is more 
complicated in real life
• Valuation is influenced by 
learning
• Learning utility is the utility 
value updated, based on 
past experiences. The 
dopaminergic system is 
involved in learning utility 
(prediction errors signals).

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• The OFC receives input from all of the major 
sensory modalities (vision, audition, somatic 
sensation, olfaction, and gustation), giving it 
access to the information necessary to identify 
options. 
• Unlike other prefrontal regions, however, the OFC 
has few motor connections, consistent with the 
idea that the OFC provides inputs to systems that 
themselves inform the selection and execution of 
behavior. 
• Furthermore, the OFC receives inputs from the 
hippocampus and adjacent regions in the medial 
temporal lobe that are involved in memory storage 
and retrieval. These inputs presumably provide 
information about prior experiences to improve 
estimates of value. 
• Finally, the OFC receives inputs from reward-
related dopamine neurons in the midbrain that 
help shape associations among objects, actions, 
and their consequences

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• Computation and 
comparison of values take 
place within prefrontal 
regions, including the OFC, 
the vmPFC
• Direct evidence for the role 
of the OFC in evaluation is 
fairly strong
Padoa-Schioppa. Ann. Rev Neurosci, 2011

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• When monkeys choose among options varying in reward amount, reward type, 
and probability of reward delivery, firing rates of some neurons in the OFC track 
individual preferences for a particular option, a variable known as subjective 
value
• When a monkey that likes bananas is fed them to satiety, the sensory 
properties of bananas remain the same but their value to the monkey is 
reduced
• Satiety is accompanied by a reduction in the firing rates of OFC neurons 
in response to more bananas, implying that the OFC encodes the 
subjective value of a food and not just its sensory properties.

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• Evidence for the evaluative role of the OFC also comes from 
neuroimaging studies.
• A study on the human enjoyment of wine: enjoyment is related to 
factors that do not affect wine taste but other factors, such as wine 
costs
• Expensive wine tastes better
• This change in appeal is reflected in changes in hemodynamic activity 
in the OFC, suggesting that the activity mediates the change in 
enjoyment associated with price

Role of 
Orbitofrontal

• In economic choice, there is no intrinsically 
“correct” answer; the choice depends on subjective 
preferences.
• In this study, authors examined trade-offs between 
commodity (juice type) and quantity. 
• In our experiments, monkeys choose between two 
types of juice (A and B;) offered in different 
amounts. For example, in the session shown in 
figure 1a, the monkey chooses between 1 drop of 
water (juice A ) and unsweetened Kool-Aid (juice 
B). In figure 1b: Offer types include 0B:1A, 1B:2A, 
1B:1A, 2B:1A, 3B:1A, 4B:1A, 6B:1A, and 10B:1A, 
and the “forced choices” 0B:1A and 3B:0A.
• The monkey indicated its choice with an eye 
movement

Role of

When offered one drop of juice A versus one 
drop of juice B (offer 1A:1B), the animals chose 
juice A. This is true also in the condition 3:1.
This situation is reversed when 4 drops of B are 
offered →Thus the monkey assigned to 1A a 
value roughly equal to the value it assigned to 
4B.
B is chosen when the amount of drops vary 
consistently (3:1).

---PAGE---

Role of 
Orbitofrontal 
cortex
The relative value is 4.1.
The monkey was roughly indifferent between 1A and 4B. 
A sigmoid fit indicated, more precisely, that 1A = 4.1B. The 
relative value (4.1 here) is a subjective measure in multiple 
senses. 
1. First, it depends on the two juices. 
2. Second, given two juices, it varies for different 
individuals. 
3. Third, for any individual and two given juices, it varies 
depending, for example, on the motivational state of 
the animal (thirst).
Thus, to examine the neural encoding of economic values, 
it is necessary to examine neural activity in relation to the 
subjective values measured concurrently.

Role of 
Orbitofrontal

On this basis, the authors computed a variety of value-related variables, which were 
then used to interpret the activity of neurons in the OFC. In particular, the analysis 
showed that neurons in this area encode three variables: 
1) offer value (the value of only one of the two juices), 
2) chosen value (the value chosen by the monkey in any given trial), 
3) and taste (a binary variable identifying the chosen juice).

Blue circles indicate the behavioral choice 
pattern (relative value in the upper left)
Red symbols indicate the neuronal firing

which the animal chose juice A
• Filled red circles and refer to trials in

Role of

d) OFC neurons encoding the chosen value. A 
linear relationship exists between the activity of 
the cell and the value chosen by the monkey in 
each trial. For this session, 1A = 2.4B. 
The activity of the cell was low when the monkey 
chose 1A or 2B, higher when the monkey chose 
2A or 4B, and highest when the monkey chose 1A 
or 6B. 
Neurons encoding the chosen value are thus 
identified on the basis of the relative value of the 
two juices. Higher activity when one option is 
clearly better than another.
e) OFC neuron encoding the 
taste. The activity of the cell 
is binary depending on the
chosen juice but 
independent of its quantity
c) OFC neurons encoding the offer value, 
the variable on which choices were 
presumably based. 
A linear relationship exists between the 
activity of the cell and the quantity of 
juice B offered to the monkey

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• The relationship between activity in the OFC and personal preferences is so 
robust that measures of brain activity in the OFC can be used to predict 
purchasing behavior in simulated marketplaces over an array of products, 
including snack foods, beverages, and ads that feature attractive people.
• Indeed, a remarkable feature of the OFC is its apparent ability to contribute 
directly to decisions about so many different things, ranging from which soda 
to buy from a vending machine to which college to attend.
• This flexibility has led to the proposal that the OFC and/or the ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) make use of a universal value “format” that allows 
comparison of any set →COMMON CURRENCY THEORY →maybe simplistic!

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• Actually making a choice occurs after evaluation and requires active 
maintenance of the values of two or more options. This process 
seems likely to occur in the OFC as well, or in the neighboring 
ventromedial PFC, a structure with similar neuroanatomy and 
function as the OFC
• Neurons in both regions show systematic changes in firing when the 
values of multiple options are maintained in short-term memory.

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• Es. Choose car →brain must make separate comparisons and use the 
results to make a decision
• Lesion →deficits in comparing the values of disparate options →less 
efficient with more options
PRICE Styling
Gas mileage Parking

---PAGE---

Role of Orbitofrontal cortex
• OFC integrates multiple sources of information regarding the reward 
outcome and it produced a value signal.
• OFC supervises NAcc
• OFC value signal can be transmitted to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) to plan and organize behaviour toward obtaining the outcome.
• OFC is highly interconnected to the neighborging ventromedial PFC 
(vmPFC)

patients persist in the face of severe adverse consequences, i.e. rising 
future punishment or declining future reward.

Experimental questions:
1. The aim of the current study is to understand the causal role of the 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) for such moral judgments 
that rely on assessments of intent in VM patients.


---PAGE---

Patients with vmPFC impairment
When we attempt to understand and evaluate other people's actions, we often draw 
inferences about their beliefs and intentions:
Typically, these beliefs and intentions match the action's outcomes but sometimes 
mismatches occur.
Prior neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence has suggested a role for the VMPC in
evaluating harmful actions.
Did they believe they 
would cause harm? Did they intend to cause harm?

RESULTS:
1) VMPC participants judged failed attempted harms as 
more permissible than BDC participants (p=0.001) and NC 
participants (p<0.001).
2) VMPC participants’ judgments did reflect a difference 
between failed attempted harms and non harms 
(p=0.018), and a difference between accidental harms and 
successful attempts to harm (p<0.001). Thus, VMPC 
participants were able to distinguish between these 
conditions by representing the content of negative beliefs 
and intentions
3) VMPC participants also judged failed attempted harms 
as significantly more permissible than accidental harms 
(t(8)=3.7, p=0.006), a pattern that was significantly different 
from the pattern observed in the BDC participant group 
(p=0.037) and the NC participant group (p=0.003) (see next 
slide).

CONCLUSIONS:
VMPC participants judged attempted harms as more 
morally permissible than both contorl groups. 
VMPC participants even judged attempted harms (e.g., 
attempting, but failing to poison someone) as more 
permissible than accidental harms (e.g., accidentally 
poisoning someone).
Notably, the pattern of moral judgments delivered by the 
VMPC patients represents not just a departure from but 
also a reversal of the normal pattern of moral 
judgments. Among healthy adults and even young 
children, attempted harms are generally judged quite 
harshly (forbidden) and usually more harshly than 
accidental harms (Cushman, 2008; Piaget, 1965/1932).

Role of DLPFC
• the DLPFC may control the responses of other groups of neurons, making them more or 
less responsive to inputs and feedback, thereby producing different responses in 
different contexts
• DLPFC →role in short-term memory the ability to keep information in mind to guide 
behavior
• Storage of information in short-term memory reflects changes in the firing rates of 
neurons in various regions of the brain, including the DLPFC. Specifically, firing rates of 
neurons in the DLPFC increase while information is maintained in short-term memory
• Damage to the DLPFC is associated with impairments in short-term memory capacity and 
duration

---PAGE---

Role of DLPFC
• Another key element in cognitive control is maintenance of rules and 
corresponding changes in behavior when the rule change.
• Neurons in DLPFC show systematic patterns of activity that accord with 
specific rules, suggesting this area also maintains a representation of 
abstract information that guides complex behaviours
• Moreover, systematic changes in the firing rates of neurons in the DLPFC 
accompany changes in the rules that govern effective behavior in a 
particular context.

---PAGE---

Role of DLPFC
• Es. WCST Wisconsin Card Sorting Task
• An individual is shown a set of cards, each of which has a different 
number of distinct shapes of varying color. The individual must then 
place a new card according to an unstated rule, such as shape, color, 
or number. After a series of trials, the rule is surreptitiously switched. 
• Patients with DLPFC damage can learn to perform this task using the 
initial rule, but when the rule is changed they tend to continue with 
the old one and perform poorly. This impairment corresponds to the 
tendency for patients with DLPFC lesions to become stuck in 
behavioral routines and not adapt to changing circumstances.

DLPFC disruption
• The disruption of the right, but not the left, DLPFC by low-
frequency rTMS substantially reduces subjects 'willingness 
to reject their partners 'intentionally unfair offers. 
• Subjects are less able to resist the economic temptation to 
accept these offers.
• Importantly, however, subjects still judge such offers as very 
unfair, which indicates that the DLPFC plays a key role in 
the implementation of fairness-related behaviors.

ACC (Area 24, parts of areas 9, 6, 32)
• Humans and other “intelligent” animals are capable of learning from 
the consequences of their actions. Doing so requires circuitry that 
can evaluate the outcomes of decisions and update the control 
systems that regulate the connections between stimulus inputs and 
behavioral outputs
• Such monitoring is most strongly associated with the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC). This region is well positioned to serve this role 
since it has multiple inputs conveying information from a variety of 
systems, including perception, emotion, attention, and memory.

---PAGE---

ACC as source of ERN (error related negativity)
• ACC is thought to be the source of the error-related negativity (ERN) 
in EEG studies
• The ERN signal is observed in standard laboratory tasks immediately 
after (or in some cases just before) an individual commits an error.
• Due to the poor localization of EEG signal sources, it is difficult to 
know with much precision which part of the brain actually generates 
the ERN. However, circumstantial evidence supports the idea that it 
arises from the ACC.

---PAGE---

ACC
• Activity in the ACC is also consistent with the evaluation of outcomes 
and generation of feedback signals useful in updating behavioral goals 
and the adoption of new cognitive rules. 
• Responses of ACC neurons are affected not so much by the nature of 
options or their values, but by the consequences of choosing them.
• In laboratory studies, ACC activated by errors that reduce rewards, 
which in real life would correspond to disappointment in not 
achieving a goal
• The ACC also tracks counterfactual or fictive outcomes—in other 
words, the rewards or punishments associated with options that were 
not chosen.

---PAGE---

ACC and Stroop effect
• ACC is involved in dealing with such 
conflicts
• Direct electrophysiological recordings 
from the ACC in human neurosurgical 
patients show evidence of this conflict
• Damage to the ACC leads to 
impairments in learning from the 
consequences of actions.
• An example is obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), which is associated with 
atypical levels of activity in the ACC.
In a typical Stroop scenario, people are faster saying the word red when it 
is printed in red ink than they are when it is printed in green ink

• Each player has to secretly turn 
the penny to heads or tails

head and one tail) →PLAYER B

Authors recorded event-related 
brain potentials (ERPs) while 
subjects played a pennies game 
against a computer opponent to 
evaluate how neural responses to 
outcomes related to subsequent
decision-making.
They measure an outcome-locked potential thought to reflect a neural 
prediction error signal.

Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (Area 44, 45, 
12, 47)
• After deciding to act and preparing to do so, individuals sometimes 
change their minds and countermand their planned actions. 
• Patients with damage to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) 
are impaired in this override function and respond impulsively
• They respond more quickly but less accurately in timed tasks, and in 
life make poor decisions in various domains, including purchases, 
dietary choices, and social interactions
• They say the first thought that pops into their mind, even if it is 
inappropriate; and they continue to make bad choices even when 
they recognize that these actions are harmful

---PAGE---

Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex
• The role of the VLPFC in inhibition is well documented
• When neuronal activity in VLPFC is enhanced (by TMS) an individual’s 
ability to suppress unwanted actions in laboratory tasks is improved
• Identifying the mechanisms that mediate behavioral inhibition 
involves using tests that target the ability to countermand learned or 
habitual actions. The go/no-go task is an example.

---PAGE---

Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex
• Individuals are told to perform a specific action when they see a 
stimulus—for example, press a button when a green light is 
illuminated.
• But occasionally a subsequent stimulus—say a red light—appears and 
supplants the first one, and the individual must ignore the green light 
and withhold the initially planned action
• Such tasks reliably and selectively activate the VLPFC, and damage to 
the VLPFC impairs performance on this task.
