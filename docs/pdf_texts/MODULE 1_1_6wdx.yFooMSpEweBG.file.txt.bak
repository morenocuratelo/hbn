Introduction
• Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field 
• Aim: to explain (using specific technique) human decision making, 
e.g. our ability to chose among multiple alternatives. 
• It studies how economic and decision making behaviors are written in 
our brain.

Evolution of economic
Classical period of 
economic theory
• In order to understand the evolution of neuroeconomics we 
have to go back to the evolution of economic
• The birth of economic is often traced to Adam Smith’s 
publication of The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Smith described a 
number of phenomena critical for understanding choice 
behavior (e.g. how characteristics of the environment 
influenced the behavior of consumers and producers).
Basic concepts: 
• wealth of any nation was determined by national income (and 
not monarch’s gold!!), 
• Income is based on the labor 
• Labor organized efficiently by the division of labor
• Theory of value (of exchange)
• Introduction of different 
concepts:
• Value
• Price
• Cost

---PAGE---

Evolution of economic
• Price is the amount paid for acquiring any product or 
service.
• Cost is the amount incurred in producing and 
maintaining the product.
• Value is the utility of a good or service for a customer.
• Market price vs Natural price (gravitational attraction)


---PAGE---

PRICE
• Price is the consideration given in return for acquiring 
a good or service. In a commercial transaction, price 
refers to the amount charged by the seller from the 
buyer, in exchange for any product or service, which 
includes cost and profit.
• It is referred by different names in different contexts:
• Fees: For the supply of professional services.
• Premium: In the case of insurance.
• Rent: For the use of place or machinery.
• Fare: In the case of transportation.
• Salary: For the work done in an organization.

---PAGE---

COST
• The cost can be defined as the total amount spent on 
the inputs like land, labour, capital, machinery, 
material, etc. with an aim of producing the product 
or supplying the services. It can be anything which 
adds to the expense of product or service 
manufactured or supplied by the firm.
• In simple terms, cost implies the financial worth of 
the sacrifice made, to obtain the goods or services. It 
is incurred for present or future benefits. The basic 
elements of cost are: Material, Labour and 
Overheads.


---PAGE---

Value
• Value can be described as the benefit derived by the customer from 
the product or service. In clearer terms, value is what a customer 
perceives the product or service is worth to them.
• Characteristics:
1. Immeasurable in nature, because the value of the product is different for 
different persons.
2. Value varies from time to time.
3. Value of a product or service greatly depends on the supply of the product 
and the demand among the buyers. (e.g. if the supply is less →demand 
more →more value)
4. Differs from one place to another.

At the end of this period, neoclassical 
economics seemed incredibly powerful. 
However different problems emerged

---PAGE---

Evolution of economy
Behavioral economics: This group of 
psychologists and economists, who began to 
call themselves behavioral economists, argued 
that evidence and ideas from psychology could 
improve the model of human behavior 
inherited from neoclassical economics 
Human beings are not rational animals. 
Different economic behaviors are not fully 
explained by these models (e.g. heuristics)
Famous experiment conducted 
by Tversky and Kahneman 
(1981). 
Allais paradox (1953):
The Allais paradox arises when comparing participants' 
choices in two different experiments, each of which consists 
of a choice between two gambles, A and B.

Conclusions
• We tend to make decisions based on how much we think we have to 
gain or lose right now
• We also tend to choose certainty over risk, even riskier options are 
closer to what we really want. 
• Sometimes we consider the probability, other times the value of the 
option.

• Famous experiment conducted by Tversky and 
Kahneman (1981) 
• Participants were asked to "imagine that the U.S. 
is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian 
disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two 
alternative programs to fight the disease have 
been proposed. Assume the exact scientific 
estimate of the consequences of the programs 
are as follows."

The answerer is no. 
We can use psychology to address this issue.

Psychology
• Psychologists question our rational behaviour
• We are irrational and we are social
Kenning & Plassmann, Brain Research Bulletin 67 (2005), 343–354

---PAGE---

Social psychologists question our behaviour as 
individuals
We are “social” animals…
1. We need to investigate human behavior in social conditions (e.g. 
Ultimatum game, or trust game)
2. We need to investigate not only behavioural variables but also 
objective measures

---PAGE---

Game theory to study “social” individuals' 
decision making
• Game theory provides a nice middle ground for neuroeconomic 
studies, because it links individual decision making to group-level 
outcomes with a clearly defined mechanism. 
• The mechanism is the game tree, which specifies who gets to move, 
when, what moves they can make, what information they have when 
they make their move, and how moves of different players interact to 
determine a joint outcome over which the players have varied 
interests.

---PAGE---

Game theory to study “social” individuals' 
decision making
• An important feature of laboratory game theory experiments is that  
participant’s decisions can be highly sensitive to the specifics of the 
implementation.
• Many game theory experiments are powerful tools for uncovering 
critical features of the human decision process that might be 
relatively difficult to detect outside of controlled environments

---PAGE---

Characteristics of game theory  experiments
• Instructions need to be clear and complete. 
• Environment needs to be well described and framed since behavior is 
highly sensitive to framing. 
• E.g. using the word “ partner ” instead of “ counterpart ” to describe a 
matched participant in an experiment can affect decisions substantially
Houser et al ., 2004

---PAGE---

Characteristics of game theory  experiments
• The role of randomization also cannot be overstated. One reason is 
that it is necessary for the validity of a variety of widely-used analysis 
procedures. 
• More generally, the appropriate use of randomization avoids 
confounding influences on the results. 
• Subjects might differ in personality traits or preferences for money
• Random assignment of subjects to treatments and roles within the 
experiment helps to ensure that such differences do not 
systematically affect an experiment’s outcome.
Houser et al ., 2008

---PAGE---

Characteristics of game theory  experiments
• To guarantee anonymity, participants are randomly assigned 
counterparts, visually separated from each other, and asked to remain 
silent for the duration of the experiment. 
• By ensuring that participants do not know with whom they are 
matched, the possibility that decisions will be based on perceptions 
unrelated to the decision environment under study is largely 
eliminated.

---PAGE---

Characteristics of game theory  experiments
• A hallmark of experimental economics is “salient rewards”. 
• Salient rewards refer to monetary payments that vary according to a 
person’s decisions in an experiment. 
• Vernon Smith formalized the importance of this procedure with the 
publication of his “Induced Value Theory” (Smith, 1976 ). As long as it 
is assumed that people prefer more money to less, applying the 
theory to experiments requires only that real money values are 
assigned to tokens earned in an experiment.
• Intuitively, the advantage of doing this is that it raises confidence that 
participants will recognize the economic incentives implied by the 
game environment.

---PAGE---

Examples of game theory  experiments
Prisoner’s Dilemma
• Prisoner’s dilemma game is used to study “ social dilemmas ” that arise when the 
welfare of a group conflicts with the narrow self-interest of each individual group 
member
Ultimatum Games
• The ultimatum game, introduced by Guth et al. (1982), is a simple take-it-or-leave-it 
bargaining environment.

---PAGE---

Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) Games 
• In a typical two-player PD, each player can choose either to 
“cooperate” or “defect”.
• Payoffs are symmetric and chosen so that the sum of the payoffs is 
HIGH when both choose “cooperate” and LOW when both players 
choose “defect”.
• However, each player earns the most if he chooses to “defect” when 
the other cooperates.
• The structure of multi-player PG games is similar, but they are 
typically played in larger groups.

---PAGE---

Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) Games 


---PAGE---

Prisoner’s Dilemma Games results
• Standard results for PD games are highly discussed in different papers 
(see, for example, Davis and Holt, 1993; Ledyard, 1995).
• The key early finding was that, in aggregate, cooperation occurs 
about half of the time in PD game.
• It is also routinely found that aggregate cooperation decays when 
these games are repeated.

---PAGE---

Ultimatum Games
• In ultimatum experiments, two people are randomly and 
anonymously matched, one as proposer and one as responder, and 
told they will play a game exactly one time. 
• The proposer is endowed with an amount of money and suggests a 
division of that amount between himself and his responder. 
• The responder observes the suggestion and then decides whether to 
accept or reject. 
• If the division is accepted, then both earn the amount implied by the 
proposer’s suggestion. If rejected, then both the proposer and 
responder earn nothing.

---PAGE---

Ultimatum Game
Practical example: a proposer and a 
responder have to agree on the division 
of a given amount of money, say $20, 
according to the following rules:
1) the proposer can make exactly one 
suggestion on how the $20 should be 
allocated between the two by making an 
integer offer X to the responder.
2) then the responders can either accept
or reject X. In case of a rejection, both 
players earn $0; in case of acceptance, the 
responder earns X and the proposer earns 
$20–X

because $1 is better than $0
If concerns for reciprocity and 
equity motivate him, he might 
reject low offers because he views 
them as insultingly unfair and 
inequitable

---PAGE---

Ultimatum Game: results
1. The key result of ultimatum experiments is that most proposers offer between 
40% and 50% of the endowed amount (donation amount), and that this split 
is almost always accepted by responders. 
2. Rejection rates up to 80% have been observed (Camerer et al., 2003) for offers 
below 25% of the available money, and rejection rates increase as the proposal 
falls to 10% and lower. Strong evidence (Henrich et al., 2001; Camerer et al., 
2003) suggests that many people reject low offers in the game, even if stake 
levels are as high as 3 months’ income (Cameron, 1999). 
3. A pioneering imaging study (Samfeu et,. 2003) showed that both the anterior 
insula - an important brain area involved in the processing of emotions - and 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are activated when responders 
decide whether to accept or reject an unfair offer.
4. As discussed by Camerer (2003), ultimatum game results are highly robust to a 
variety of natural design manipulations (e.g., repetition, stake size, degree of 
anonymity, and a variety of demographic variables).

We cannot study a single brain and predict an 
individual’s behaviour
Conclusion 1: we need to study social behaviour in order to understand 
decision making
Conclusion 2: we need to study behaviour using different methods

---PAGE---

Conclusion 1: Study social behaviours
• Crucial to study economies: 
• individual level 
• society as a whole (Krugman & Wells, 2004)
• Study how human beings coordinate their wants and desire, given the decision-
making mechanisms, social customs and political realities of the society 
(Colander, 2006)

Definition of economics
• Taking together different definitions…
Economics is a social science concerned with the production, 
distribution and consumption of goods and services. It studies how 
individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices on 
allocating resources to satisfy their wants and needs, trying to 
determine how these groups should organize and coordinate efforts to 
achieve maximum output.

---PAGE---

Definition of economics
Economics can generally be spitted into 2 subfields:
Macroeconomics
• It is related to the behaviour of aggregate 
economy (nations, world economy)
Microeconomics 
• It focuses on individual consumers and 
businesses

optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by 
considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with 
perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully rational.

• In contrast, positive or descriptive decision theory is concerned with 
describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that the 
decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules.

EEG is a recording of 
electrical activity produced 
by neuron’s firing
MEG is a recording of the magnetic fields 
produced by electrical activity in the brain. MEG 
uses extremely sensitive devices called 
superconducting quantum interface devices. 

---PAGE---

5. EEG and MEG
• Neurons are organized 
structure. 
• Populations of neurons can 
be seen as dipoles, 
negatively charged on the 
top and positively charged in 
the middle.
• This difference induces local 
electrical fields that can be

positioned outside the brain.

5. EEG and MEG
EEG is sensitive to the 
electrical, local current 
induced by active 
populations of neurons.
Local current induces 
magnetic fields that can be 
detected by MEG.
EEG detects 
electrical currents
MEG detects 
magnetic fields

5. EEG and MEG: pros vs cons
PROS
• EEG is cheap 
• Perfect time resolution
CONS
• MEG is expensive
• Bad spatial resolution
• MEG and EEG reflect post-
synaptic potentials

6. fMRI
• Measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood 
flow.
• This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and 
neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, 
blood flow to that region also increases.
• The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent 
(BOLD) contrast (Ogawa, 1990) →record changing in blood flow 
(hemodynamic response) related to energy used by the brain cells.

• The relationship between brain function and blood flow 
changes was first investigated in 1890 by Charles Smart Roy 
and Charles Scott Sherrington. 
• In the late 1870s, i.e. 10 years before Roy and Sherrington’s 
research, Mosso wrote his previous observations on the 
hypothesis that an attentional or cognitive task can locally 
increase cerebral blood flow.
• The fMRI method can be explained by a very interesting 
and old study conducted by Mosso.

Mosso developed the ‘human circulation balance’.
The ‘human circulation balance’ invented by Mosso consisted of a 
wooden table lying on a fulcrum. Subjects were first asked to lie 
down on the balance and not to move. Subsequently, after an 
initial adaptation phase needed for the blood to redistribute 
equally within the bodily tissues, the subject was steadily 
repositioned so as to overlap the barycenter with the central pivot 
of the fulcrum. 
This overlap was partially achieved by careful 
regulation of balance weights but also, as 
Mosso showed, by adjustments to the level of 
water inside a glass bottle positioned on one 
side of the table

Once equilibrium was reached, the only observable movement was 
that induced by breathing during inspiration. Because this might 
cause a transitory increase in blood flow towards the lower 
extremities, the wooden table was linked to a heavy counterweight 
to dampen respiratory fluctuations

After the resting period, Mosso sequentially 
exposed the subjects to a wide range of stimuli 
of increasing cognitive complexity, such as a 
page from a newspaper, from a novel, from a 
manual of mathematics or philosophy, or a 
page written in abstruse language (Mosso, 
1935). He reported that the increasing 
complexity of the stimulus modulated cerebral 
blood activity: the balance tilted faster towards 
the head side when the subject was reading a 
page written in abstruse language or belonging 
to a manual than it did when the subject was 
reading a newspaper or a novel

E = mc2
Basically when we make some 
complex mental activity, our 
brain is activated, so neurons, 
need more energy, that is 
more oxygen. 
This triggers an increase of 
blood flow to the brain. 
This changes the weight of the 
brain.

E = mc2
This is the basic of the fMRI method.
The blood vessels of our brain carry O2 to neurons. 
When neurons are active (e.g. during a mental 
activity) specific brain regions require hemoglobin, 
that carries O2.
Hemoglobin changes the magnetic properties of 
brain tissues and these changes can be detected by a 
scanner. Thus, the scanner detect the BOLD signal.

So there are two major types of MRI: 
STRUCTURAL: collects structural 3D atlas of 
the brain
FUNCTIONAL (fMRI): collects the activations 
of different brain areas during specific tasks 
(e.g. record the brain activity during the 
decision making process). 
MRI (high 
resolution, 1mm)
fMRI (low 
resolution, 3mm)
