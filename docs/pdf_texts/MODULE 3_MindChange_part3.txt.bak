• The present research explores 
whether having online access 
to search engines and
databases has become a 
primary transactive memory 
source in itself.
• Authors designed 4 different 
experiments:
EXPERIMENT 1
EXPERIMENT 2
EXPERIMENT 3
EXPERIMENT 4

EXPERIMENT 1:
• participants were tested in two 
within-subject conditions
• they answered either easy or 
hard yes/no trivia questions in 
two blocks.

Question: Which is the capital of Karnataka?
Modified Stroop test to text RTs
Answer:  …

EXPERIMENT 1:
• Each block was followed by a 
modified Stroop task to test 
reaction times to matched 
computer (e.g. presentation of 
wards such as “screen”, or 
“google”) and everyday terms.
< RTs for naming the color of interested 
words

EXPERIMENT 1:
• Paired within-subject t tests were 
conducted on color-naming reaction 
times to computer and general words 
after the easy and difficult question 
blocks.
• RESULTS: computer words were more 
accessible then general words when 
participants had encountered a series 
of questions to which they did not 
know the answers
• CONCLUSION: It seems that when we 
are faced with a gap in our knowledge, 
we are primed to turn to the computer 
to rectify the situation. This effect is 
more robust for hard questions.

EXPERIMENT 2:
• Authors tested whether people 
remembered information that 
they expected to have later 
access to 
• Participants had to read 40 
statements. 
• Participants divided in 2 groups:
• Half of them were led to believe 
the statements would be saved and 
available to look up later; 
• the other half were explicitly 
instructed to attempt to remember 
them.

EXPERIMENT 2:
• RESULTS: Participants apparently 
did not make the effort to 
remember when they thought 
they could later look up the 
trivia statements they had read. 
• CONCLUSIONS: Because search 
engines are continually available 
to us, we may often be in a state 
of not feeling we need to encode 
the information internally. When 
we need it, we will look it up.

EXPERIMENT 3:
• Authors tested memory for where
to find information that one might 
look up online.
• Participants again red and typed in 
statements, this time in three 
within subject conditions:
1/3 questions →“Your entry 
has been saved in a general folder.”
1/3 questions →“Your entry 
has been saved into the folder X”
1/3 questions →“Your entry 
has been erased.”

EXPERIMENT 3:
• Recognition trial: 
Participants had to judge yes or no 
1) whether the statement they were 
now shown was exactly what they 
had read
2) whether the statement had been 
saved or erased, and finally,
3) if the statement had been saved 
to a folder, which folder it had been 
saved into
“Was this statement exactly what you read?” 
Was this statement saved or erased?”
If the information was saved, what folder was 
it saved into?”

EXPERIMENT 3:
“Was this statement exactly what you 
read?” 
RESULTS: Participants recognized the 
accuracy of a large proportion of 
statements. But for those statements 
they believed had been erased, 
participants had the best memory.
CONCLUSION: believing that one won’t 
have access to the information in the 
future enhances memory for the 
information itself

EXPERIMENT 3:
“Was this statement saved or erased?”
RESULTS: Participants accurately 
remembered what they had saved more 
than they accurately remembered what they 
had erased.
CONCLUSION:  believing the information 
was saved externally enhances memory for 
the fact that the information could be 
accessed, at least in general.
Saved         Erased

EXPERIMENT 3:
“If the information was saved, what
folder was it saved into?”
RESULTS: Participants did remember more that the information 
was erased than specifically whether the information was 
generally saved or which folder it was saved into.
CONCLUSION: This result is a reminder of the experience of 
remembering something you have read online that you 
would like to see again or share but no longer remembering 
where you saw it or what steps you took to find it in the first 
place, or even knowing that a file is saved onto your hard 
drive but having t use the search feature to find it

EXPERIMENT 4: 
• Was conducted to see if 
people would recall “where”
to find information more than 
the information itself (“what”)
• Participants believed all trivia 
statements that they typed 
would be saved into one of 
five generic folders
Statement: The capital of Karnataka is Bangalore


---PAGE---

Google effect
EXPERIMENT 4:
RESULTS: 
• When asked to recall the folder names, 
they did so at greater rates than they 
recalled the trivia statements themselves. 
• A deeper analysis revealed that people do 
not necessarily remember where to find 
certain information when they 
remember what it was, and that they 
particularly tend to remember where to 
find information when they can’t 
remember the information itself.
CONCLUSION:
We adapt our memory to recall information 
(what or where).

Internet 
exploration
• As a type of hypermedia, the Internet combines graphics, 
audio, video, text and hyperlinks in an interactive and 
nonlinear environment. 
• Users must decide how to find information, what 
information to read, which hyperlinks to followand 
when to modify behaviours. 
• Consequently, for the Internet to be a valuable resource, 
individuals typically must be autonomous and active in 
their learning.

---PAGE---

Internet 
exploration
• Researchers have identified that learners with low
domain knowledge, on average, have exhibited little or 
no learning gains after studying from hypermedia 
environments, including the Internet
• In general, attention has been regarded as a major 
influence on the information that is remembered; 
affecting entry, maintenance and retrieval of information

---PAGE---

• Eye-gaze was recorded
• Eye-gaze information was used to 
determine the time spent 
attending to relevant information. 
• Based on the time spent viewing 
relevant look zones the following 
two scores were created: 
(a) the duration of time spent 
within the look-zone during 
the initial visit of a particular 
link, and 
(b) the duration of time spent 
within the same look zone 
during revisitation of the link

Internet 
exploration
• N = 84 undergraduate students with high 
and low levels of sustained attention (65 
females and 19 males, with a mean age 
of 20.46 years)
• Students were tasked with navigating 
the Internet for 20 minutes to learn 
about how tropical cyclones form

---PAGE---

• Students with high level of attention →more frequently guided their 
learning in a linear manner, alternating between search engine results 
and first links. Rarely did these learners select hyperlinks presented 
on the links themselves, and it was these students who performed 
better on the test
Internet 
exploration


---PAGE---

• Learners with low levels of sustained attention →typically took advantage 
of the opportunity to jump around between sources of information. While 
they alternated between search engine results and first links, the low-
attending learners engaged in far more exploration of the hyperlinks 
presented than the high-attending learners did. However, the hyperlinked 
sources were typically irrelevant. So, perhaps not surprisingly, those with 
short attention spans performed more poorly on the test than those who 
were able to focus longer

performance can be even 
more marked when we look 
across age groups

Readings
• The authors explored 
effects of the 
technological interface 
on reading 
comprehension in a 
Norwegian school 
context
• N = 72 tenth graders from 
2 different primary 
schools in Norway.
• Students randomized into 2 groups:
Read 
this text
Read the same text as pdf 
on a computer screen
Read 2 texts (1400-
2000 words) in print

---PAGE---

Readings
• Regression analysis was 
carried out to investigate to 
what extent reading 
modality would influence 
the students’ scores on the 
reading comprehension 
measure
• RESULTS: students who 
read texts in print scored 
better on the reading 
comprehension test
• Pedagogical implications?


---PAGE---

Readings
• This paper aims to assess the 
usability of electronic books (e-
books) and paper books (p-
books) with objective measures, 
including user comprehension, 
eye fatigue, and perception
• N = 56 sixth-year public school 
students participated in this 
study


---PAGE---

Readings
• Eye fatigue →Participants’ eye fatigues were measured by critical 
flicker/fusion frequency (CFF) threshold. 
• CFF is defined as the frequency at which a flickering light is in 
distinguishable from steady, non-flickering light
• CFF is widely used as highly sensitive measurement to evaluate retina 
functionality and it is an effective for assessing the eye fatigue


---PAGE---

Readings
This paper was conducted in the 
following order: 
1) pre-CFF measurement, 
2) p-/e-book reading,
3) post-CFF measurement, 
4) quiz and questionnaire. 
5) exit


---PAGE---

Readings
RESULTS: 
1) there is a significant “book 
effect” on quiz scores →
compared to e-books, p-books 
appear to enable better 
reading comprehension
2) Regarding eye fatigue, students 
had significantly greater eye 
fatigue after reading e-books 
than after reading p-books. 
3) Students were satisfied with 
the e-book, but they preferred 
p-books.

Multitasking
• A distinguishing feature of 
digital technology is the 
temptation and opportunity it 
offers for multitasking
• In a survey of two thousand children between the ages of eight and 
eighteen, the time spent multitasking between more than one 
technology medium in 1999 was 16 percent but had almost doubled 
to 29 percent ten years later.

Multitasking
• In a survey of U.S. college 
students, 38 percent said they 
could not go for more than ten 
minutes while studying without 
checking their laptop, 
smartphone, tablet, or e-reader
• Since media multitasking involves, by definition, shifting attention 
between multiple sources, much research has focused on how much 
information can be retained, and how efficiently, when individuals 
multitask between media

Multitasking
• Chronic media multitasking is quickly becoming ubiquitous, 
although processing multiple incoming streams of information is 
considered a challenge for human cognition. 
• A series of experiments addressed whether there are 
systematic differences in information processing styles between 
chronically heavy (HMMs) and light media multitaskers 
(LMMs).


---PAGE---

Multitasking
• A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify 
groups of heavy and light media multitaskers. 
• The questionnaire addressed 12 different media forms: 
print media, television, computer-based video (such as 
YouTube or online television episodes), music, nonmusic
audio, video or computer games, telephone and mobile 
phone voice calls, instant messaging, SMS (text 
messaging), email, web surfing, and other computer-
based applications (such as word processing). 
• For each medium respondents reported the total number 
of hours per week they spend using the medium


---PAGE---

• The goal was to examine whether there is a relationship between 
chronic media multitasking and cognitive control abilities.
• Different hypothesis →
Multitasking
Positive
Light media multitaskers exhibit 
advantages in cognitive control 
This result would motivate future work to 
establish whether heavy multitasking 
confers or reflects these advantages
Negative
Heavy media multitasking behavior is 
associated with deficits in cognitive 
control
This result would offer important 
prescriptive guidance irrespective of the 
direction of causality. If chronic media 
multitasking is the cause, then a change in 
multitasking behavior might be warranted

---PAGE---

• Three tests in the study involved the subjects looking at shapes, 
numbers, or letters, but the task was to remember something about 
just some of the images on the screen and to ignore the others.
Multitasking
FILTERING TASK, example for shapes

---PAGE---

Multitasking
RESULTS: 
Heavy media multitaskers are more 
susceptible to interference from irrelevant 
environmental stimuli
CONCLUSIONS:
the high multitaskers seemed unable to 
ignore the shapes they were told to ignore, 
and were unable to filter out what wasn’t 
important to that particular task. In all 
cases the low multitaskers outperformed 
their high-multitasking counterparts
