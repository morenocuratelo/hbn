• Day 1 (baseline): no treatment → 
normal pain tolerance 
• Day 2 and 3: morphine → augmented 
pain tolerance 
• Day 4: Told morphine, Given placebo + 
naloxone (opiod antagonist) → pain 
tolerance returns to baseline 
What we observe is that participants no 
longer respond to the placebo, and their 
pain increases (similar to day one).
→ HERE, PLACEBO EFFECT IS

One of the most extensively 
studied systems in placebo 
research is the pain system.

PLACEBO ANALGESIA AND ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS: CCK MODULATION
Proglumide (CCK antagonist): 
• CCK normally inhibits endogenous 
opioids
• Blocking CCK → enhances endogenous 
opioid production and availability
• Result: stronger placebo effect due to 
more free opioid receptors 
Pentagastrin (CCK agonist): 
• Mimics naloxone effect → blocks 
placebo effect
• Activates CCK → inhibits 
endogenous opiodis → opioid 
receptors unavailable

→ The placebo effect here is not opioid-
mediated.

---PAGE---

Placebo analgesia depends on the 
neurotransmitter system engaged during 
preconditioning
• If preconditioned with opioids → blocked with naloxone 
• If preconditioned with cannabinoids → blocked by rimonabant 
→ Past experiences, expectations, and psychosocial context can 
trigger analgesia via the “drug memory” mechanism.
→ The brain “remembers” drugs that produced analgesia previously. 
When a person expects the drug, endogenous opioids or 
cannabinoids are released, bind to their specific receptors, and 
induce analgesia even without the actual drug.
→ In other words, placebo analgesia depends both on the drug itself 
and on the memory of its effects.

Role of DLPFC in 
Placebo Analgesia 
Key Points:
• Maintains the “placebo effect”: helps sustain the expectation of 
analgesia.
• Reduces pain perception: even when the actual pain intensity is the 
same as baseline.
• Consolidates priors: triggers endogenous analgesic mechanisms 
based on prior drug experience.
• Sensory modulation: decreases incoming pain signals when no 
active drug is administered.
Implication:
In placebo analgesia studies, greater DLPFC activity indicates stronger 
cognitive control over pain perception.

All participants received remifentanil, at a fixed dose. 
The study aimed to test how expectations modulate the effect of a real drug: 
1. No expectancy: patients received remifentanil without knowing its effect
2. Positive expectancy: participants received remifentanil and, therefore they 
expected pain relief
3. Negative expectancy: participants received remifentanil but thought they were not 
receiving it anymore

DECREASE IN N2-P2 
complex during placebo 
analgesia
The N2–P2 complex is a component of laser-
evoked potentials (LEPs) that reflects cortical 
processing of painful stimuli, particularly the 
conscious perception and evaluation of pain.
In this study, both verbal suggestion and 
conditioning altered the N2–P2 complex, 
indicating a change in how the brain processes 
pain signals.
However, only conditioning led to a reduction 
in perceived pain, suggesting that learning 
through prior positive experience (rather than 
expectation alone) modulates pain both 
neurophysiologically and subjectively.

CONDITIONED ANALGESIA AND THE ROLE OF VERBAL

Two conditioning blocks: one cue 
paired with increased pain and the 
other with decreased pain
 
• VER group receives information 
about the meaning of the cue,
• noVER group does not 
Participants 
learn the 
association 
between visual 
cues and pain 
intensity. 
• Purpose: assess whether the 
association learned during 
acquisition affects pain perception.
• Measures: pain ratings (0–10)
and LEP N2–P2 amplitudes.
All cues are 
presented 
with the 
same pain 
intensity, 
regardless of 
the cue.

Another study investigates how expectations modulate pain, underlying placebo 
hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. 
It is novel in using the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), an electrophysiological 
marker of cognitive anticipation and motor preparation, to separate sensory and 
motor components of pain.
• Experiment 1 (conditioning): 
– Acquisition: cues paired with non-painful (green) or painful (red) stimuli.
– Test: stimulus intensity kept constant to isolate expectation effects.
• Experiment 2 (expectation only):
– No conditioning; expectations induced by cues alone.
• Measures:
– CNV: early (cognitive anticipation) and late (motor preparation) components.
– Pain ratings: subjective perception.
– Reaction time: time to stop painful stimulation.

Green cue → expected pain reduction (placebo) 
Red cue → expected pain increase (nocebo) 
Measures: 
• RT: reaction time to stop the stimulus 
(if slower → no unconscious expectation of painful stimulus, if 
faster → unconscious expectation of painful stimulus) 
• Pain Rating: Conscious, anticipatory system
• EEG recording 

---PAGE---

Se rosso mi aspetto ‘preparazione’ maggiore per stoppare lo stimolo (onda più gonfia)
Se stimoli rosso e verde stessa intensità → se ti ho condizionato dopo il rosso ti prepari a schivare 
come fosse intenso come prima. 
A livello comportamentale i rossi sono più alti dei verdi, invece i tempi di reazione rimangono identici 
tra rosso e verde. 
Come se il mio corpo avesse capito bene che gli stimoli sono uguali,ma la mia coscienza no, anche se 
in realtà l’ho evitato come fosse debole 
Invece la CNV divide due aspetti diversi → solo la EARLY CNV predice il comportamentale. Invece  a 
livello di preparazione motoria (LATE CNV) è identico. 
La parte automatica del motorio è molto più difficile da influenzare rispetto alla parte consapevole. 
Pain rating : increased with red cue → 
painful stimulus
Reaction time → decreased with red cue 
CNV → red cue → bigger effect → more 
preparation to avoid the stimulus 
Pain rating: increased with red cue → 
neutral stimulus 
Reaction time → red cue = green cue 
CNV → red cue → bigger effect only in 
the early one
The conscious, anticipatory system can be influenced by conditioning, 
whereas the automatic motor system is much harder to modulate

group, a clear decrease in 
interleukins and interferon-
gamma was observed compared 
to baseline.
• Later, participants were given only 
the flavored beverage, without any 
drug
• Despite the absence of 
Cyclosporine A, researchers still 
observed a significant reduction in 
interleukin and interferon-gamma 
levels, though smaller than in the 
drug phase.
• This demonstrated a conditioned 
immunosuppressive response
The immune system can be influenced by associative learning, 
similarly to behavioral conditioning.

PD Treatments
• Drug treatment: L-Dopa
Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, is converted into dopamine by the enzyme dopa-
decarboxylase in dopaminergic neurons. The main problem is that only a small 
fraction (~5–10%) actually reaches the target neurons in the brain that control motor 
symptoms. The rest is converted into dopamine elsewhere, where it is not needed, 
causing side effects such as nausea, low blood pressure, heart issues, and involuntary 
movements.
To reduce these side effects, levodopa is often combined with peripheral dopa-
decarboxylase inhibitors (like carbidopa or benserazide), which block dopamine 
formation outside the brain and increase the amount reaching the neurons.
• Surgical Treatment: DBS
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a major surgical treatment for Parkinson’s. The 
patient is awake, with the head fixed, while two microelectrodes are inserted through 
small holes to stimulate the subthalamic nucleus, a key area involved in the disease. 
Being awake allows doctors to check in real time if the electrodes cause any problems.

Improvements in RCTs
• Improvement in parkinsonian 
symptoms in the placebo 
group in several clinical trials 
(pharmacological and 
surgigical)
Goetz et al., (2002, 2008)
• Pharmacological: placebo vs 
sarizotan comparison 
(serotonergic action) on 
dyskinesias (involuntary 
movements)
• Surgical: Comparison of 
patients undergoing real or 
simulated intra-striatal 
transplants of pig fetal ventral 
mesencephalic tissue
As with pain, in many trials the natural history group is missing: the improvement can be 
due to both the placebo effect and other factors (regression to the mean, spontaneous 
remission, etc.)

---PAGE---

• Surgical trial (McRae et al., 2004):
• No difference between real intervention and placebo 
("effectiveness of transplantation of human embryonic 
dopamine neurons")
• Difference based on patient perception:
– Patients who thought they had undergone the real surgery had 
a benefit up to 12 months after the surgery
Example of surgical trial

---PAGE---

• In certain clinical trials, such as those testing surgical 
treatments like embryonic dopaminergic neuron 
transplants, the observed improvement often came from 
the patient’s belief that they were in the treatment group, 
rather than the treatment itself. 
• There was no real difference between the surgical trial and 
control groups. 
• The clinical benefit typically lasted about a year. 
This shows that perception of allocation strongly influences 
outcomes. 
Even when blinding is properly maintained, patients may form 
opinions about their treatment, which can affect the 
measured efficacy.

---PAGE---

Improvement in behavioral studies
• The expectation of clinical improvement plays a crucial role
• Typical experimental situation: placebo is administered 
giving the patient positive expectations of improvement
• Bradykinesia is the symptom more sensitive to positive 
expectations, compared to tremor and stiffness

---PAGE---

Patients were divided into two 
verbal suggestion groups:
• “Bad” condition: told they 
would perform poorly
• “Good” condition: told they 
would perform well
They were also told that DBS 
would not affect their 
performance. 
Results showed that verbal 
instructions alone could worsen 
or improve motor performance.
The study also tested 
conditioning effects: if patients 
were conditioned, their 
movement speed improved even 
when later given a placebo 
instead of apomorphine. 
This shows that conditioned 
placebo effects are stronger and 
longer-lasting than simple 
expectation alone.

This study showed that thalamic activity changes
observed during surgery persisted into the next day and 
depended on how many apomorphine preconditioning 
sessions patients had received.
•Control group: no intervention or placebo → no changes in thalamic 
activity or rigidity.
•Placebo 0: only expectation of treatment, no preconditioning → no 
significant effects.
•Placebo 1–4: received 1–4 apomorphine preconditioning sessions → the 
more sessions, the greater the clinical improvement.
•Placebo 1: minimal, non-significant effect
•Placebo 2: noticeable improvement
•Placebo 3: clear improvement in rigidity and thalamic firing
•Placebo 4: strong, rapid effect similar to apomorphine
When placebo was administered during surgery, rigidity improved and thalamic 
firing rate increased markedly, lasting up to a day 
→The degree of conditioning directly determined the strength and duration of 
the placebo effect.

Patients’ expectations about treatment can 
significantly enhance its clinical efficacy, even 
when the actual dose is lower.
