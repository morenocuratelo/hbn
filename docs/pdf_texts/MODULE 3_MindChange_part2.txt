Time on videogames
• A 2012 study of U.S. adolescents reported that boys between the ages of 
ten and thirteen were playing on average a staggering forty-three hours a 
week (although, admittedly, the number of subjects was fairly small, 184).
• Yet even conservative estimates (from 2009) indicate that the average U.S. 
child between the ages of eight and eighteen is spending seventy-three 
minutes a day recreationally in this one screen-based activity, up from 
twenty-three minutes in 1999.
• In a survey of U.S. youth between ages ten and nineteen, gamers spent 30 
percent less time reading and 34 percent less time doing homework.

Videogame and the brain
• Aviv Weinstein at the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem 
believes that the craving for online gaming and the craving for 
substance dependence could well share the same neurobiological 
mechanism.

Craving hypothesis
• N = 9 abstinent “ecstasy” 
users and 8 control subjects 
• They were scanned at 
baseline and after 
performing on a motorbike 
riding computer game while 
imaging dopamine release in 
vivo with single photon 
emission computed  
tomography (SPECT)
Weinstein, A. M. (2010). Computer and videogame addiction: A comparison between game users and non-game users. 
American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse 36, no. 5, 268–276. 


---PAGE---

Craving hypothesis
• The brain imaging study showed that 
healthy control subjects had reduced 
dopamine D2 receptor occupancy of 
10.5% in the caudate after playing a 
motorbike riding computer game 
compared with baseline levels of 
binding consistent with increased 
release and binding to its receptors.
• Ex-chronic “ecstasy” users showed no
change in levels of dopamine D2 
receptor occupancy after playing this 
game. 


---PAGE---

Craving hypothesis
• For the nonaddicts experiencing the thrill 
of gaming, there was an increase in the 
release of dopamine that “desensitized” 
its receptors.
• But the brains of the Ecstasy addicts told 
a different story. Here chronic use of the 
drug had accustomed the brain to vast 
amounts of dopamine. The videogames 
added no excitement because they 
worked via the same common 
mechanism. 
• It seems that as far as the brain was 
concerned, taking Ecstasy and gaming 
were comparable experiences


---PAGE---

Craving hypothesis
• In young gamers, brain imaging shows an enlargement of the area of 
the brain (the ventral striatum) where the neurotransmitter 
dopamine is released. 
• Interestingly enough, a similar feature is also characteristic of the 
brains of pathological gamblers, who suffer from another behavioral 
addiction. 
• So it seems that whether we’re talking about addiction to drugs, 
gambling, or videogames, all three conditions are linked to excessive 
dopamine release in the ventral striatum.

Chicken and eggs dilemma
individuals with brains that happen to have an enlarged 
ventral striatum are predisposed to gaming
excessive gaming has literally left its mark on the brain

---PAGE---

Chicken and eggs dilemma
• Let’s start with the chicken: that gaming, as with all life 
experiences, leaves its mark on the impressionable, 
plastic brain.
• According to Kuhn et al., the more time spent playing, 
the more pronounced the expansion of the striatum. 
This suggests the former caused the latter.
• The higher the video-game hours →the higher the 
striatal volume
Kühn et al., (2011). The neural basis of gaming. Translational Psychiatry 1, no. 11, e53. 

---PAGE---

Gaming →mark in the 
brain
• N = 154, 14-years-old
• Division between: frequent and infrequent
• Moreover, they  assessed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task 
during fMRI imaging and a Gambling Task (CGT)
• During the MID task, participants see cues that indicate that they may win or 
not win money, then wait for a variable anticipatory delay period, and finally 
respond to a rapidly presented target with a button press to try to either win 
or avoid losing money. 
• During the CGT, participants made simple probabilistic judgments between 
two mutually exclusive outcomes, and then placed a bet on their confidence 
in that decision


---PAGE---

Results:
• higher left striatal grey matter volume when 
comparing frequent against infrequent video 
game players
• higher activity during loses
Conclusion:
• The key finding of higher volume in left ventral 
striatum associated with frequent video game 
playing is in conceptual accordance with 
findings of enhanced dopamine release during 
video game playing and excessive gambling in 
Parkinson’s patients due to dopaminergic 
medication.

• Considering the CGT task →negative correlation between the gray 
matter volume in the left ventral striatum and the deliberation time in

Chicken and eggs dilemma
• Then there’s the egg: the idea that a preexisting brain 
state might predispose individuals to compulsive gaming
• Kirk Erickson at the University of Illinois found a 
correlation between the volume of a key brain area, the 
dorsal striatum, and later training success in a 
videogame
Erickson et al., (2010). Striatal volume predicts level of videogame skill acquisition. Cerebral Cortex 20, no. 11, 2522–2530 

---PAGE---

Chicken and eggs dilemma
• Erickson has also described a link, again seen with imaging, 
between activation of the striatum before training and 
subsequent later skill acquisition during gaming. 
• These findings highlight the importance of the striatum, a 
rich source of dopamine, and how this might be consistent 
with the idea that some brains are more susceptible to the 
lure of games. Individuals who happen to have a larger 
striatum might experience gaming as more rewarding in the 
first place. 
• This neurological setup, in turn, could facilitate skill 
acquisition and lead to further rewards from playing.
Erickson et al., (2010). Striatal volume predicts level of videogame skill acquisition. Cerebral Cortex 20, no. 11, 2522–2530

Big striatum →more 
videogame
• N = 42 (age 15-28)
• Infrequent players (< 3 hours of video games a week during the 2 
years prior to the study)
• Participants were given instructions about the Space Fortress game 
and then, before game training, completed an MRI session 
• They were then given 20 h of Space Fortress game training


---PAGE---

Big striatum →more videogame
• The Space Fortress game requires players to navigate their ship with 
precise control using a joystick. 
• The ship moves in an environment, and players can rotate the ship by 
moving the joystick left or right or by applying a thrust by pushing 
forward on the joystick. 
• The ship has no braking system, so that in order for players to slow or 
stop the ship, they must rotate it so that it faces the direction 
opposite to its current direction of motion and apply a thrust. 
• This requirement makes control of the ship a challenging and 
demanding task.

---PAGE---

Big striatum →more videogame
RESULTS:
• hippocampal volumes 
did not predict learning 
improvement but 
striatal volumes did.
• The volumes of the 
dorsal striatum
predicted improvement 
in performance. 
• Both ventral and dorsal 
striatal volumes 
predicted early 
acquisition rates.


---PAGE---

Striatum: the key area of the dilemma
• Striatum →structure divided into 2 parts: an upper (dorsal) zone and 
a lower (ventral) one. The latter releases more dopamine than the 
former
Drevets et al., (1999). PET measures of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in ventral versus dorsal striatum. 
Neuropsychopharmacology 21, no. 6, 694–709. 
Robbins et al., (1992). Functions of dopamine in the dorsal and ventral striatum. Seminars in Neuroscience 4, no. 2, 119–127. 
• DORSAL STRIATUM →the dorsal 
striatum coordinates sensorimotor 
functions for attaining a goal
• VENTRAL STRIATUM →dopamine 
released from the ventral part enhances 
the impact of the actual reward that 
then ensues


---PAGE---

Striatum: the key area of the dilemma
So one way of resolving the 
chicken-and-egg problem 
might be to say that a brain 
predisposed to effective 
sensorimotor coordination, 
with an active dorsal 
striatum, will have a 
predisposition for gaming, 
while it is the games 
themselves that change the 
way the ventral striatum 
reacts to reward.

Dopamine as crucial contributor 
• A second way to solve the chicken-eggs problem is to 
consider the dopamine.
• Neuroscientists at Hammersmith Hospital in London 
have shown that playing videogames directly results 
in release of this neurotransmitter.
• Raised levels of dopamine are consistently linked to 
various brain states relating to reward, addiction and 
arousal. 
• Different studies investigated the role of arousal and 
individual’s capacity for excitement.

Arousal of different videogames
• One investigation found different 
patterns of arousal in different 
types of gamers. 
• Those who played excessive 
amounts of first-person shooter 
videogames had significantly 
higher levels of arousal during 
gaming, which dropped off 
immediately after gaming.

---PAGE---

Arousal of different videogames
• MMORPG (Massive[ly] 
Multiplayer Online Role-Playing 
Game) players who gamed 
excessively displayed significant 
decreases in physiological
arousal, which rose again 
immediately after gaming.
• Meanwhile, MMORPG players 
who didn’tplay excessively
showed normal increases in 
arousal during gaming and then 
reached a plateau after their 
session.


---PAGE---

Arousal of different videogames vs gambling
• These differences in arousal for gamers are comparable to those 
reported in the scientific literature on pathological gambling.
• There are the thrill-seeking, impulsive addicts who take stimulating 
substances or engage in high-risk behaviors; by contrast, there are 
the escapists, the often depressed addicts who are not seeking high 
arousal.


---PAGE---

Chicken and eggs complication applies
these disturbances in arousal regulation could be either a cause 
of gaming addiction
Or a consequence of it


---PAGE---

Videogames and rewards
• What finally determines an individual’s level of arousal and whether he or 
she becomes addicted to one or another type of videogame?
• How can we solve the dilemma?
• It is impossible to tease out a cause-and-effect sequence of events as the 
brain interacts with the environment, and therefore it is hard to predict 
with any accuracy whether someone will become addicted to videogames.
• More plausible view would be that what goes on in the brains of those 
addicted to videogames is not qualitatively different but rather 
quantitatively different from what happens in the brains of those who are 
less obsessive.

---PAGE---

Videogames and rewards
• MMORPGs have been studied because excessive gaming is most 
commonly seen in MMORPGs
• The reward structure built into the game influences the development 
of excessive gaming
• MMORPGs have intricate reward 
systems built into the games, with 
gamers constantly trying to reach the 
next level

---PAGE---

Videogames and rewards
• Moreover the social interaction with other players appears to be the 
real extra hook.
• Perhaps the appeal is that the player is now not just playing a game 
but playing out an idealized life that is simultaneously exciting and 
safe, both physically and mentally

• Craig Anderson, professor and chair of psychology at Iowa State 
University and a leading researcher in the field of videogame 
violence, is concerned that while violent games do not cause 
extreme, criminal-level violent behavior, they do enhance low-level 
aggression.
• Anderson’s suggestion is that the link between aggression and gaming 
is an indirect and generalized association. Indeed, it’s quite plausible 
that subconscious leanings toward violence could be transformed into 
overtly conscious ones via gaming and through repetition could 
become automatic, the default mode.

As expected, violent video game players had lower 
cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels 
than did nonviolent game players. 
This research offers another possible reason why violent 
games can increase aggression—by inducing stress. 
Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress 
induced by violent video games. 
Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological 
features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against 
environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not 
subject to demand characteristics, and
easy to use.

• Beyond aggressive behavior toward others, violent videogames clearly do 
have a demonstrable effect on the brain and body. 
• Research has linked violent videogames to changes in the fight-or-flight 
system that has evolved to prepare the body for action by pumping blood 
around the body more quickly, putting digestion on hold, cooling down the 
skin with sweat, and so on. 
• It seems that players can become habituated to this adrenal rush, such that 
living through a realistic violent experience will no longer trigger strong 
reaction.

were less active during violent gaming
• The authors suggest that these areas must be

hesitation
• Furthermore, there was activation of areas associated 
with aggression and cognition, paralleling the 
activation that occurs during real-life violence.

child often interrupted another child’s work

Videogames and attention
RESULTS:
1) those who had more than two hours of screen time 
(television and videogames combined) per day were 
more likely to be above the norm in showing attention 
problems. 
2) playing games was linked specifically to a greater risk of 
developing attentional problems, and that it was in fact 
a more robust predictor than television viewing

• N = 3000 children and adolescents tracked 
over 3 years
RESULTS:
• Children who spent more time gaming had 
more attention problems
• Children who were more impulsive or had 
more attention problems subsequently spent 
more time playing videogames

• Research shows that gamers make 
excellent drone pilots, and even 
outperform real pilots on certain 
tasks. 
• In the same spirit, scientists at the 
Duke School of Medicine have 
investigated just how effectively 
skilled gamers might eventually 
become highly proficient drone 
pilots, compared to their student 
colleagues who didn’t play action 
games

• The experienced gamers beat 
their rookie counterparts, 
proving that they could 
respond to visual stimuli 
much more quickly
• “Gamers see the world 
differently. They are able to 
extract more information 
from a visual scene,” 
Appelbaum concludes. “They 
need less information to 
arrive at a probabilistic 
conclusion, and they do it 
faster.”

• They were interested in whether 
learning could improve performance in 
different tasks other than those on 
which the training was focused
• Subjects were aged between 18 and 23 
years. Divided in 2 groups: 
• 5 experiments: 
• experiment 1–4 included only males 
• in experiment 5, both male and female 
NVGPs underwent training
Green and Bavelier (2003). Action videogame modifies visual selective attention. Nature 423, no. 6939, 534–537. 
The Video Game Players (VGPs) had played 
action video games on at least 4 days per week 
for a minimum of 1 h per day for the previous 6 
months. Videogames: Grand Theft Auto3, Half-
Life, Counter-Strike, Crazy Taxi, Team Fortress 
Classic, 007, Spider-Man, Halo, Marvel vs 
Capcom, Rogue speare and Super Mario Cart
The No Video Game Players (NVGPs) had little, 
and preferably no, video-game usage in the past 
6 months.

nonplayers who had been subsequently 
trained on an action videogame showed 
a marked improvement that transferred

• The evidence is convincing that games can have beneficial, remedial effects 
over a wide range of impairments, including a reversal of cognitive decline 
in the elderly.
• In one study, the researchers trained older adults in a videogame for a total 
of 23.5 hours. They assessed their subjects with a battery of cognitive 
tasks, including tests for executive control and visuo-spatial skills, before, 
during, and after videogame training. 
• The subjects improved significantly within the game but, most important, 
also showed clear improvement in executive control functions, such as task 
switching, working memory, short-term visual memory, and reasoning.

Playing videogames could also potentially have positive effects on more abstract 
aspects of brain function, such as social development and psychological well-being. 
For example:
1. Ability to see details 
2. Fast processing of fast presented information
3. Improved short memory
4. Improved capacity to process simultaneously 
5. Flexibility to change from one task to another

Conclusions on attention
• Selective attention →ability to focus on a specific category of stimuli. 
This attention is driven by motivation and leads to reactive control 
(respond to different stimuli presented in the same time)
• Sustained attention →ability to focus for a prolonged period
This attention leads to proactive control (respond constantly to 
stimuli presented over time)
Videogame players often respond to fast stimuli →no advantage in 
Sustained attention

47, no. 1, 34–42.
