FACTORS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT
When we administer a treatment, this treatment can lead to an 
improvement due to several factors:
1) Specific factors→related to the treatment→active principle 
2) Methodological factors
3) Non-specific factors

METHODOLOGICAL 
FACTORS
NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS
Treatment administration
The decrease of pain is the result of the methological factors, non specific factors and 
the active principle together

---PAGE---

METHODOLOGICAL FACTORS: 
NATURAL REMISSION
• Natural remission: happens in a lot of conditions (e.g. Anxiety, 
Depression, Headache...) that have spontaneous fluctuations (natural 
history of a disease, a symptom).
• Natural remission →natural course of a symptom, of a disease, in 
the absence of specific interventions
• ERROR: Mistake the natural remission for the efficacy 
• SOLUTION: introduce a control group in which the natural course of 
the disease/symptom is studied →“natural history group”

---PAGE---

METHODOLOGICAL FACTORS: 
REGRESSION to the MEAN
• Statistical phenomenon (non-biological and non-psychological)
• If a variable is extreme at its first measurement, it will tend to be 
closer to the mean at its second measurement.
Example: 
• A medication that lower blood sugar is tested on a patient with 
extremely high glucose levels. 
• On a second measurement, the values are lower and closer to the 
population average
• This change may not be ddue to the modification, but rather to 
regression to the mean → the statistical tendency for extreme values 
to move closer to the average on repeated measures 

---PAGE---

METHODOLOGICAL FACTORS:
BIASES , ambiguity of the symptom, errors
• Hawthorne effect (effect of being observed): people tend to work harder or 
perform better when they feel they are being watched or studied.
• Pleasing the Experimenter: participants may alter their behavior to fit what 
they believe the researcher expects or wants to see (consciously or 
unconsciously) in order to please the experimenter or confirm the study’s 
hypotesis. 
• Measurement errors
• Use of subjective (and non-objective) scales to assess often ambiguous 
symptoms (e.g. pain)
• Unidentified co-interventions

CLINICAL TRIALS
• Gold standard → RCT (Randomized – double blind – placebo 
controlled – Clinical Trial)
• Examples of "historical" controlled trials:
1. Mesmerism (Mesmer, commissioned by Benjamin Franklin →
there is no magnetic fluid, it is a matter of imagination or 
spontaneous remission)
2. Homeopathy (Hahnemann, bread tablets compared with 
homeopathic tablets →same effect!)

---PAGE---

CLINICAL TRIALS
Research conducted to collect data on the safety and efficacy of new 
drugs, new clinical procedures or new medical devices.
They are conducted after the approval by competent authorities and an 
ethics committee.
They are characterized by PHASES (see phases of clinical trials).
Clinical trials in which participants receive a treatment whose effects 
are compared to another treatment or an inert treatment (placebo).

0. Preclinical phase
1. PHASE I

3. PHASE III  
4. PHASE IV

---PAGE---

PHASE 0 –Discovery and early 
testing 
• Discovery and selection of molecules
• Laboratory analysis on cells and animals
• Administration of extremely small doses of 
the drug under study to obtain preliminary 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the agent 
• Request for authorization of human trials
• They do not provide data on safety and 
efficacy


---PAGE---

PHASE I –Safety and dosage 
• Typically on humans (volunteers) (20-80 
subjects)
• Typically on healthy subjects (sometimes on 
terminal patients in the absence of other 
treatments)
• It is used to test the pharmacokinetics and 
toxicity
• If the safety of the drug has been confirmed, 
we move on to phase II
Phase II

---PAGE---

PHASE II –Efficacy
• Testing of the molecule on larger groups (300-
400 subjects).
• Patients who have the pathology for which 
the particular molecule is to be tested are 
recruited
Phase III
If benefits are 
observed

---PAGE---

PHASE III –
Approval phase
• Increasing the number of patients 
(multicenter studies with 2000-3000 patients)
• Approval phase
 If few side effects
and good efficacy


---PAGE---

PHASE IV –Post-marketing 
surveillance
• MARKET LAUNCH
• Phase that lasts "forever“
• The recording of side effects continues.
• Ex: Thalidomide, marketed after animal testing 
(late 50s)
→Lancet study
→administration of thalidomide to pregnant mice 
resulted in the birth of broods with severe limb 
malformations (phocomelia)
→Recall from the market→Mandatory testing on 
pregnant animals→compensation to the "victims"
If few side effects
and good efficacy

• STANDARD TRIALS (Phase I, II and III):
• If active arm > placebo arm →We proceed with the other phases of

PLACEBO IN CLINICAL TRIALS: PROBLEMS
One therapy is tested by comparing the "active treatment arm" with the 
"placebo arm".
Unfortunately, this comparison often generates uncertainty for several 
reasons:
• Wrong interpretation (I report a difference that does not exist). 
• Inability to find a difference between active treatment and placebo arm
• Increase in negative RCTs over time

However, HIDDEN administration of 
proglumide (without the patient's 
knowledge) has NO effect on pain 
perception. It is no different from 
placebo.
The explanation is that proglumide does 
not act as a painkiller but as a placebo 
booster (or expectancy booster)

CONTEXTUAL FACTORS: 
what are they and how have they been studied?
Therapeutic outcome is influenced by: 
1.PATIENT’S INVIDUAL VARIABLES: 
• Psychological variables: patients who respond well to placebo (responders) 
tend to be less anxious and more optimistic 
• Genetic variables: studies have shown that certain genetic profiles respond 
better to contextual factors than others. 
→A PET study found a reduction in amygdala activity only in subjects with 
a specific serotonergic variant (only in subjects homozygous for the long 
allele (5-HTTPLR)) or the G variant of the G-703T polymorphism (→
placebo treatment for anxiety)
→The same has been observed in depressed patients, where individuals 
with particular monoamine typologies respond better to certain contexts 
(poor response in G and G/G and Met-Met)
• The simple act of administering a treatment can trigger expectations 
• Exposure to the therapeutic setting 
• Verbal or non-verbal interaction 
• Past medical history

CONTEXTUAL FACTORS: 
what are they and how have they been studied?
Therapeutic outcome is influenced by: 
2.PHYSIOTHERAPIST: 
• A doctor who presents himself as competent, experienced, polite, 
professional, trustworthy, able to provide a clear diagnosis and a 
clear prognosis and who monitors the patient with adequate follow-
up, can modulate the patient's symptom by virtue of his or her 
behavior.
• It has been shown that the information and opinion of the physician 
regarding the clinical pathway, regarding the therapy and the 
prognosis→influence therapeutic outcome
• Nonverbal communication plays a huge role
• The use of Therapeutic Touch can have an impact on the patient's 
symptom
• In addition to verbal and non-verbal communication, touch is the 
third modality involved 
→a powerful emotionally important somatosensoty stimulus is represented 
by holding hands (social support and affection) Testa & Rossettini, 2016, Manual Therapy

shock under three conditions: 
→ not holding hands/spouse 
hand/stranger hand

No hand     spouse    unknown
unpleasantness
When they held their spouse’s hand, they reported 
less unpleasantness and showed reduced activation
in brain regions involved in processing emotional and 
behavioral responses to threat, specifically the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), nucleus 
accumbens, and colliculus.
Here was also reduced activation in the ventral 
anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), posterior cingulate, 
postcentral gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus when 
holding the hand of either their spouse or a stranger

Therapeutic outcome is influenced by: 
3.TREATMENT:
• The formulation of a clear diagnosis that explains the symptoms to the 
patient and gives meaning to the disease is in fact a form of treatment 
(Hopayian and Notley, 2014)
• Detailed diagnoses and comprehensive explanations are appreciated by the 
patient→Increased satisfaction→Therapeutic adherence (Hush et al., 2011; 
Ludvigsson andEnthoven, 2012; Pinto et al., 2012)
• Patient-centered treatment
• Organizational aspects→same therapist, clarity, adequate length of sessions, 
punctuality, flexibility, frequency and duration of follow-ups→increase 
patient satisfaction →better outcome

Therapeutic outcome is influenced by: 
4.PATIENT-PHYSIOTHERAPIST RELATIONSHIP:
• Appropriate verbal communication is a prerequisite for a good therapeutic 
relationship (Parson et al., 2007).
• Supportive verbal expressions, active listening, encouragement, empathycorrelate 
with patient satisfaction and can influence therapeutic outcome (Hush et al., 2011; 
Oliveira et al., 2012; Pinto et al., 2012;O'Keeffe et al., 2015)
• Patients not satisfied with interruptions, lack of empathy and arrogance (O'Keeffe et 
al., 2015)
• Facial expressions and eye contact are crucial therapeutic means (Pinto et al., 2012) 
since they bring important "meanings" to the patient (Benedetti, 2013)
• Facial expressions change the processing of pain stimuli (Wieser et al., 2014) and 
modulate placebo analgesia (Valentini et al., 2014).
• Gestures, postures, and physical contact add meaning to verbal interaction (Josephson 
et al., 2015; O'Keeffe et al., 2015).

ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE USE OF PLACEBO
• Use of placebo prohibited dentologically in certain conditions (e.g.
depression, suicide risk, patients with cancer, etc.).
• Without the placebo group, is it possible to evaluate the efficacy of a 
treatment?
• Possible use of trials with two active drugs (Old vs New) to evaluate 
the efficacy of the drug.
• Possible use of open-hidden trials.

Expectation
“Placebo interventions, such as sugar pills or saline injections, can be 
vehicles of therapeutic responses, but not by virtue of containing 
medication or internal properties with the power to produce beneficial 
health outcomes. Instead, the placebo intervention—a placebo pill, 
saline injection, and the invasive procedure or device that works by 
virtue of the placebo effect—should be understood as a signal, or set 
of signals, which convey information”

Expectation: Peirce's theory
•According to Peirce's theory (1839-1914), when one is in 
front of a sign (index, symbol or icon) we speak of 
"translation" to identify the process by which it is possible to 
derive meaning from the particular sign. Triadic relation of 
signs, object and interpretant

---PAGE---

Expectation: Peirce's theory
Signs are anything that elicits an interpretation of an 
object. They are classified into 3 categories:
1. Indexes →signs that are dynamically connected with 
objects and with the senses and memories of the 
individuals to whom they serve as signs. They refer to 
a given object for the simple fact that there is a 
relationship of concrete proximity between the index 
and the indicated object (e.g. smoke indicates the 
presence of fire)
2. Symbols →signs that refer to the object according to 
conventions (so they are arbitrary!)
3. Icons →signs that refer to the object on the basis of a 
similarity between the sign and the object
Colloca & Miller, 2003
= warning 
→ arbitrary
= risk of fire → 
similarity between the 
sign and the object 

---PAGE---

Expectation: Peirce's theory
•We actively interpret the signs of the objects that surround us
•This interpretation produces changes in our body that add to 
the changes produced by the object itself

---PAGE---

Expectation: Atkinson's expectancy-value 
theory
•Behaviors in stressful situations can be predicted based on the 
interaction between the expectation of being able to cope with 
such situations, borrowed from past experiences, and the 
subjective value of the specific situation (Atkinson and Reitman, 
1956)
Behaviors in stressful situations: 
Expectation (past experiences)+ Subjective value
•In a care setting, subjective value is typically associated with the 
hope of surviving the disease, as well as with the hope of reducing 
pain and more generally symptoms associated with the disease. 
•A better clinical outcome can be predicted if the expected 
improvement following treatment administration has a high 
personal value and if the patient has a high sense of self-efficacy.
Atkinson and Reitman, 1956; Horne and Weinman, 2002

Expectation: Kahneman and Tversky's 
prospect theory
•The idea behind these theories is the balance between loss 
and gain
•In decision-making, potential losses tend to carry greater 
weight than anticipated gains
•In a clinical setting, patient anxiety and concerns about 
treatments may be more relevant in predicting patient 
behavior than potential benefits of treatment
Kahneman and Tversky, 1979

Expectation: Rescorla-Wagner's model
•Expectations develop as a result of an associative learning 
process.
•According to the Rescorla-Wagner model, expectations are 
learned following trials (learning what to expect).
•The strength of expectations is given by the number of trials that 
confirm the association→learning rate
•Learning is reconceptualized in terms of changes in expectations
Rescorla, 1967

Expectation: ViolEx-model
• Rief et al., developed a model that conceptualizes how expectations 
influence different clinical outcomes and explains how the violation 
of expectations leads to behavior change or perseverance
• At the basis of the proposed model there is the interaction between 
EXPECTATIONS and CLINICAL CONTEXTS (e.g. going to the doctor for 
treatment).
• Interaction with the physician leads to predictions, outcomes, and 
evaluations of therapeutic outcome that can confirm or disconfirm 
pre-existing expectations.

ViolEx-model
Rief and Petrie, 2016
When we receive medical treatment:
1) Generalized pre-existing expectations→may amplify the effects 
of the treatment or worsen them (nocebo effects)
2) The interaction between generalized pre-existing expectations 
and the medical context leads to specific predictions,
3)   Associated with typical anticipatory anxiety reactions
4) Once the treatment has been administered, the patient evaluates the treatment to 
understand whether or not it corresponds to their expectations
5) The more frequently positive expectations occur, the more stable generalized 
expectations will become (confirmation)
6) Conversely, if the expected outcome does not occur, expectations are modified as a 
result of expectation violation.. The change can be more or less adaptive.
It is a crucial point for several 
aspects:
• Patients have expectations
• Doctors have expectations
• Doctors' and patients' 
expectations may differ
• Patients saw other doctors and 
received other treatments

7) The development of expectations is determined by at 
least three different factors: 
• previous experience (associative learning)
• social influences (direct or indirect social learning via 
social media)
• cognitive processes specific to the individual patient
8) Finally, generalized expectations are dependent on genetic 
and psychological traits and individual differences

Bayesian Perspective
• Following the Bayesian perspective, our 
brain is a probabilistic machine that 
generates predictions (priors) about 
incoming sensory stimuli.
• When the priors update in relation to 
sensory experiences (sensory input), 
posteriors are generated, i.e. priors updated 
by the new evidence
• The discrepancy between Prior and Sensory 
Input is referred to as Predictive ERROR

According to Bayesian Perspective and ViolEx model
• Expectation violation followed by update →can be attributed to 
one’s having a prior with low precision which is updated accordingly 
with the newly acquired evidence (i.e., according to this view, the 
patient who is shown that lifting their arm does not lead to their 
shoulder to break and therefore updates such dysfunctional belief, 
does not have a highly confident negative prior). 
• Expectation violation followed by the maintenance of the 
dysfunctional belief →would be understood as the consequence of 
one’s having a highly precise prior which is considered highly reliable 
and therefore, the newly acquired disconfirmatory evidence is not 
sufficient to disproof and update such strong prior. Indeed, the 
attribution of high certainty to such prior can motivate the 
engagement of higher-order cognitive strategies, such as cognitive 
immunization
Rossettini et al., 2022 (under review)
So why is it that, in certain cases, negative beliefs persist even after 
being disconfirmed?

Thoracotomized patients were treated with buprenorphine 
on request for 3 consecutive days, together with a basal 
intravenous infusion of saline solution. 
The symbolic meaning of this basal infusion was changed in 
three different groups of patients. 
When patients were certain they were 
receiving a powerful painkiller, their 
request for buprenophine decreased 
→ Strong positive expectation → 
patient already feels less pain

Role of time expectation
Camerone et al., Psychosom Med, 2021
Temporal expectations play a crucial role in modulating when and how pain is 
perceived
(study with a inert cream) 
• Placebo effects emerge at the expected time and remain stable 
• Nocebo effects emerge at the expected time and increase over time 
«The cream will 
be effective after 
five minutes»
«The cream will 
be effective after 
15 minutes»
«The cream will 
be effective after

Social Learning vs Classical 
Conditioning vs Expectation
Learning from a model: 
it can be observed that
another subject experiences
a reduction in pain following the activation of two 
electrodes (sham placebo)
NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOCIAL LEARNING
AND CLASSICAL CONDITIONING
- Direct experience and observation are more effective than verbal 
suggestion alone 
- Placebo effects can be socially modulated, not just individually

The placebo effect does not 
extinguish after partial 
reinforcement
Partial vs continuous 
reinforcements
• Partial reinforcement (RPF) induces placebo 
analgesia that is more resistant to extinction 
than contiuous reinforcement (CRF) 
• CRF produces stronger initial analgesia, but 
RPF leads to longer-lasting effects.
