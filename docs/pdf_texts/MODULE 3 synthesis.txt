Module 3: Technology, Learning, and the 
Brain (Complete Summary)  
1. Change of the World: from 3D to 2D  
Based on the work of Susan Greenfield, the fundamental premise for this module is that we 
are living through an unprecedented environmental shift from a "3D world" to a "2D world."  
The 3D to 2D Transition  
The two environments can be defined as:  
● 3D World:  The physical, tangible world of "real life" in which human brains evolved.  
● 2D World:  The screen-mediated environment (PCs, smartphones, tablets) where we 
spend an ever-increasing portion of our time.  
This new 2D environment has specific, defining characteristics that differ from the 3D world:  
● Technology is pervasive ("Tech is everywhere").  
● Information is de -contextualised ("Facts can be accessed at random").  
● There are no lasting consequences ("Actions can be reverse[d]").  
● Time is compressed and non-linear ("Time is short").  
● There is an expectation of 24/7 responsiveness and productivity.  
Why This Change Is Unique  
This technological shift is different from previous ones (like the invention of the car or 
electricity) for two main reasons:  
A) Pervasiveness 
Digital technology is not just a tool; it has become an all -encompassing environment.  
● Statistics (citing 2011 - 2012 data; e.g., Prensky, 2001; Keen, 2007; Selwyn, 2009; 
KidScape, 2011):  
○ Commerce:  71% of US adults bought goods online. 
○ Socialising:  22.5% of all online time was spent on social networks.  
○ Relationships:  Over 1/3 of US couples married 2005-2012 met online. 
● Behaviour:  It has become the default way to experience life. A 2012 Badoo survey found 
24% of social media users reported "missing a key moment" in real life because they 
were too busy posting about it (Badoo, 2012).  
● Functionality:  A single device (smartphone/PC) has absorbed dozens of separate real -
world functions (work, maps, alarm clock, shopping, news, communication, leisure, etc.).  
B) From "Means" to "End"  

---PAGE---

This is a crucial distinction. A car is a means to an end (getting from A to B). Electricity is a 
means to an end (powering a light).  
In contrast, the digital environment (like a social network) has become an end in itself . It is the 
"place" where people live, socialise, and build their identity, not just a tool to accomplish a 
separate task. 
The Generational Divide  
T hi s 2D  transi ti on i s the fi rst to create a profound generati onal  gap, as defi ned by M arc 
Pr ensk y  ( 2 001 ) : 
● Digital Immigrants:  Those born in the 3D world who "learned the language" of 
technology as adults. Like someone learning a second language, they will always retain 
an "accent" —a "foot in the past."  
● Digital Natives:  Those born into the 2D world. It is their "mother tongue." They have 
known nothing else.  
The most common modern scenario is that parents are Digital Immigrants, while their 
children are Digital Natives . This creates a fundamental gap in how these two generations 
perceive and interact with their environment.  
2. How Our Brain Works and Changes  
This section establishes the biological basis for the lecture's core argument: the human brain 
is not fixed but is profoundly shaped by experience. This principle is known as 
neuroplasticity . 
The Core Principle: The Brain Adapts  
The brain is sculpted by a lifetime of experiences. As brain development expert Bryan Kolb 
(2009) states, "Anything that changes your brain, changes who you will be."  
This is not a passive process. Experience alters brain activity, which in turn changes gene 
expression. Behavioural changes reflect physical alterations in the brain, and conversely, 
behaviour can change the brain.  
Evidence for Neuroplasticity  
A large body of research demonstrates that the brain physically adapts to the environment 
and to specific training.  
● Animal Studies:  
○ Historical Evidence (Malacarne, 1783):  Trained dogs and birds showed an 
increased number of folds in the cerebellum (Doidge, 2007).  
○ Enriched Environments (Rosenzweig, 1964):  Rats in "enriched cages" (with toys) 

---PAGE---

developed superior problem -sol vi ng sk i l l s and measurabl e physi cal  brai n changes 
compared to rats i n "standard cages."  
○ Gene- Environment Interaction (Van Dellen et al., 2000):  Mice with the 
Huntington's disease gene raised in an enriched environment developed movement 
problems much later and less severely, showing how "nurture" (environment) 
interacts with "nature" (genes).  
● Human Studies (Specific Skills):  
○ Early Life Plasticity (Bavelier & Neville, 2002):  In cases of early blindness, the 
visual cortex is not being used for its normal job, so it adapts to process sound 
inputs. This "cortical remapping" can result in sharper hearing.  
○ London Taxi Drivers (Maguire et al., 2000):  Compared to controls, taxi drivers had 
significantly increased grey matter volume in the posterior hippocampus  (spatial 
navigation). The volume correlated positively with the amount of time spent as a taxi 
driver. 
○ Musicians (Elbert et al., 1995):  String players have a larger cortical map 
(representation) for the fingers of their (more active) left hand. These structural 
differences are linked to the intensity of practice . 
○ Mathematicians (Aydin et al., 2007):  Grey matter density in the right inferior 
parietal region  was strongly correlated with the duration of time the person had 
spent as an academic mathematician.  
○ Juggling (Draganski et al., 2004):  After three months of training, subjects showed 
a significant expansion of grey matter in the mid - temporal area (hMT/V5)  (motion 
processing). After three months of no practice , this expansion decreased, 
demonstrating the "use it or you will lose it" principle.  
Given this overwhelming evidence, a pervasive shift from the 3D to the 2D world will inevitably 
be causing significant and widespread changes to our brains.  
3. Effects on Identity and Relationship

● Real (life) Self:  T he conventi onal  sel f, constrai ned by face -to -face soci al  norms.  
● True Self (Carl Rogers, 1951):  T he i nternal  sel f, based on exi sti ng characteri sti cs that 
are not al ways ex pressed i n soci al  l i fe. 
● "Hoped - for, possible self" (Zhao et al., 2008):  T hi s i s the modern soci al  medi a sel f. I t

is a curated identity that represents not who we are, but who we want to be  (or who we 
want others to thi nk we are).  
A Kid S c a p e (201 1 ) survey found that 50% of young peopl e (1 1 -18) lie  a b o ut  p e rs o na l d e t a ils  
onl i ne to create i denti ti es that are "more sex y" or "more adv enturous."  
A study by Meshi et al. (2016)  found that the degree of self -related sharing on Facebook 
was positively correlated with the resting -state functional connectivity between the Medial 
Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC)  (self-referential thought) and the Dorsolateral Prefrontal 
Cortex (DLPFC)  (executive function).  
The Reward of Sharing and "Likes"  
Sh a rin g  in fo rm a t io n a b o u t  o n e s e lf is  in t rins ic a lly re wa rd in g . Tamir & Mitchell (2012)  
demonstrated that sel f -di scl osure acti v ates the brai n's core reward systems —speci fi cal l y the 
Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) —i n the same way that pri mary rewards l i ke food and sex do.  
So c ia l me d ia  p ro vid e s  "Qua nt ifia b le  So c ia l End o rs e me nt " (QSE) in t h e  fo rm o f "like s ," wh ic h

● An fMRI study by Sherman et al. (2016)  found that vi ewi ng photos wi th many like s  (vs . 
few) was associ ated wi th greater acti v i ty i n the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) .

● T hi s NA cc responsi vi ty to soci al  reward appears to peak around age 1 6 -17, h ig hlig h t ing  a

● T he features of soci al  medi a (i nstant grati fi cati on, unpredi ctabi l i ty) mak e them powerful  
"dopamine triggers" ( Weinschenk, 2009 ). 
Effects on Social Relationships  
T he transi ti on to a 2D worl d has changed the quantity , quality, and style of our social 
re la t io ns h ip s . 
Wh ile  t h e  numb e r o f o nline  "frie nd s " h a s  g ro wn (Kanai et al., 2011 ), the number of true 
confidants  (peopl e wi th whom one can di scuss i mportant matters) i s decl i ni ng ( McPherson 
et al., 2006 ). 
W e are al so spendi ng l ess ti me i n face -to -face i nteracti on and more ti me i n non -o ra l, t e xt-
b a s e d  c o mmunic a t io n (Ofc o m, 20 12). Th is  s h ift  h a s  a  s ig nific a nt , me a s ura b le  p hys io lo g ic a l 
consequence.  
A  key study by Sel tzer et al . (201 2) i nvesti gated the hormonal  effects of di fferent types of 
soci al  support after a stress test:  
● Hormonal Results:  

---PAGE---

○ Full Contact  (in person) and Verbal Contact  (by phone) led to an increase in 
Oxytocin  (the "bonding" hormone) and a decrease in Cortisol  (the "stress" 
hormone). 
○ Instant Message  (text only) and No Contact  groups showed no increase in 
oxytocin and their cortisol levels remained high. 
● Conclusion:  The purely textual information in an instant message is not enough  to 
provide physiological emotional support. The prosodic cues  (the tone of voice) are 
critical.  
This shift has been linked to a general decline in empathy  (Konrath et al., 2011 ) and 
deficits in face processing  (He et al., 2011 ). The N170 effect (a brainwave component for 
face processing) was found to be significantly smaller  in excessive internet users (EIUs). 
Finally, the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc)  is biologically linked to social media usage. Studies 
show NAcc sensitivity to reputation predicts Facebook use ( Meshi et al., 2013 ), and lower 
NAcc volume is associated with higher frequency of checking Facebook ( Montag et al., 
2017), pointing to a potential biological basis for addictive -like behaviour. 
4. Effects on Free Time, Aggression, and Attention  
Th is  s e c t io n e xp lo re s  t he  imp a c t  o f vid e o g a me s , a  p rima ry "2D wo rld " a c t ivit y, o n t he  b ra in's

Videogames, Free Time, and Addiction  
Vid e o g a ming  is  a  d o mina nt  le is ure  a c t ivit y, d is p la c ing  o t h e r a c t ivit ie s  like  re a d ing  a nd  
homework  (H omer et al .,  201 2;  Cummi ngs &  V andewater,  2007). 
T hi s i ntense engagement i s l i nk ed to the brai n's reward sy stem and dopamine  (W ei nstei n &  
L ej oyeux, 201 0). Studi es show that frequent vi deo game pl ayers show an enlargement of 
the ventral striatum (NAcc) , a feature al so seen i n pathol ogi cal  gambl ers (K ühn et al ., 201 1 ).  
T hi s l eads to a "chicken and egg" dilemma : 
1. The "Chicken" (Gaming changes the brain):  K ühn et al . (201 1 ) found that the more 
time spent gaming, the more pronounced the expansion of the left ventral stri atum.  
2. The "Egg" (The brain predisposes to gaming):  Erickson et al . (201 0) found that the 
volume of the dorsal striatum  (sensori motor control ) before  trai ning predicted  s kill 
a c q uis it io n in a  ne w vid e o g a me . 
A  possi bl e resol uti on i s that a l arger dorsal striatum  mi ght predi spose someone to be good 
at games, whi l e the act of playing  then changes the ventral striatum  (the reward system).  
D i fferent game genres are al so l i nk ed to di fferent arousal  patterns (M etcal f &  Pammer, 

---PAGE---

2014): 
● First -Person Shooters (FPS):  Linked to higher arousal during play ("thrill -seeking" 
model). 
● MMORPGs: Linked to decreased arousal during play ("escapist" model).  
Videogames and Aggression  
A  l arge body of research expl ores the l i nk between vi ol ent vi deogames and aggressi on.  
● Behavioural Aggression:  
○ Konijn et al. (2007):  Fo und  t h a t  a d o le s c e nt  b o ys  wh o  "wis h fully id e nt ifie d " wit h  a  
realistic violent  game character were the most a g g re s s ive , willing  t o  us e  no is e  le ve ls  
they bel i eved coul d cause permanent hearing damage  to a partner.  
○ Hasan et al. (2012):  Found that v i ol ent games i ncrease "hosti l e ex pectati on bi as" 
(the tendency to percei v e hosti l e i ntent), whi ch i n turn i ncreases aggressi on.  
● Physiological Effects (Desensitisation):  
○ Carnagey et al. (2007):  Parti ci pants who pl ayed a violent game showed a 
s ig nific a nt ly lower heart rate (H R ) and lower g a lva nic  s kin re s p o ns e  (GSR) wh ile  
watchi ng vi deos of real-life vio le n c e . Th e y we re  p h ys io lo g ic a lly d e s e n s it is e d . 
● Brain Correlates:  
○ Mathiak & Weber (2006):  fMR I  studi es show that pl aying vi ol ent games is 
correl ated wi th deactivation  in e mo t io na l re g io ns  like  t h e  Rostral Anterior 
Cingulate (rACC)  and the Amygdala . T his suggests emotional  and empathetic 
brai n regi ons are suppressed to al l ow the pl ayer to act v i ol entl y wi thout hesi tati on.  
Videogames and Attention  
T he i mpact of gami ng on attenti on i s twofol d, creati ng both benefi ts and defi ci ts.  
● The "Bad" (Sustained Attention):  
○ Gaming i s l inked to more teacher -reported attenti on probl ems (Swi ng et al ., 201 0).  
○ Th e  link is  bidirectional :  gami ng can l ead to attenti on probl ems, and those wi th 
attenti on probl ems are drawn to gami ng (Genti l e et al ., 201 2).  
○ Gami ng ex peri ence i s negatively associated  wit h  "p ro a c t ive  c o nt ro l," o r t h e  a b ilit y t o  
sustai n attenti on (B ai l ey et al ., 201 0). 
● The "Good" (Selective Attention):  
○ Green & Bavelier (2003):  T hi s cl assi c study found that experi enced acti on gamers 
were signifi cantl y better than non- gamers at v i sual  selective attention  tasks (e.g., 
t ra c kin g  mu lt ip le  o b je c t s ). Th e y p ro ve d  c a us a lit y b y t ra in in g  no n-gamers, who then 
showed the same i mprovements.

5. Effects on Memory and Learning  
T hi s fi nal  secti on expl ores how constant i nformati on access and mul ti taski ng are changi ng 
c o g nit ive  func t io ns  re la t e d  t o  le a rning . 
The "Google Effect" (Transactive Memory)  
T he i nternet has become a pri mary form of "transacti v e memory," an ex ternal  system where 
i nformati on i s stored col l ecti vel y outsi de oursel ves.  
A key study by Sparrow, Liu, & Wegner  investigated this:  
● Experiment 1 (Priming):  When faced with difficult trivia questions, participants were 
primed  to think of computer -related words.  
● Experiment 2 (Encoding):  The group that believed trivia statements would be saved 
had significantly worse memory for the information itself.  
● Experiment 3 & 4 (Remembering "Where" vs. "What"):  Participants had the best 
memory for the content  of statements they believed had been erased . However, they 
were generally better at remembering where information was stored (i.e., which folder) 
than the information itself.  
● Conclusion:  We are adapting our memory to prioritise remembering how to find  
information (the "where") rather than the information itself  (the "what"). This affects 
semantic memory  (general facts).  
Information Seeking (Googling)  
The act of searching is a distinct cognitive skill that physically changes the brain.  
● Small et al.:  An fMRI study found that "Net Savvy" (experienced) older adults showed 
increased activation in regions for decision - making and complex reasoning  while 
searching, compared to "Net Naïve" users. After just five days of training, the "Naïve" 
group's brains began to look like the "Savvy" group's.  
● Desjarlais:  An eye-tracking study found High -Attention Students  used a linear search 
(search engine -> link -> search engine) and performed better  on a comprehension test. 
Low - Attention Students  jumped between hyperlinks in a non -linear way, got lost in 
irrelevant sources, and performed worse. 
Reading on Paper vs. Screen  
The physical medium we use for reading has a measurable impact on comprehension and 
fatigue.  
● Mangen et al.:  Students who read texts in print  scored significantly better  on a reading 
comprehension test than those who read the same text as a PDF.  

---PAGE---

● Jeong:  This study confirmed that students had better reading comprehension from 
paper books (p - books) . Using CFF (critical flicker/fusion frequency) to measure eye 
fatigue, it also found students had significantly greater  eye fatigue after reading e-
books .

● Ophir et al. (2009):  Thi s foundati onal study identifi ed Heavy Media Mul titaskers (HMMs)
