Rats in enriched cages showed physical changes in neural circuits \\(structural plasticity\\) as a result of experience\\.\n\nD\\. Enriched environments caused the rats to become aggressive and less intelligent\\.\n\n__2\\. Van Dellen Study \\(Huntington\u2019s Chorea\\)__\n\nQ2\\.1 In the study by van Dellen et al\\. \\(2000\\) on mice with Huntington\u2019s Chorea, what was the effect of living in an enriched environment?\n\nA\\. It accelerated the onset of the disease, making symptoms appear earlier\\.\n\nB\\. It had no effect on the genetic progression of the disease\\.\n\nC\\. It cured the disease completely, eliminating the genetic mutation\\.\n\nD\\. It delayed the onset of movement problems and reduced the degree of impairment, demonstrating that nature and nurture interact even in genetic disorders\\.\n\nQ2\\.2 What does the van Dellen study suggest about the relationship between genes and environment?\n\nA\\. Genes are the sole determinant of brain development and disease progression\\.\n\nB\\. Environment can modulate the expression of genetic traits and alter the course of a neurological disorder\\.\n\nC\\.

Videogaming and the reward system__\n\nQ1\\.1 According to the study by Weinstein and Lejoyeux \\(2010\\), how does the 'craving hypothesis' relate videogaming to substance dependence?\n\nA\\. Videogaming relies on serotonin production, whereas substance dependence relies on dopamine\\.\n\nB\\. The craving for online gaming and substance dependence likely share the same neurobiological mechanism involving dopamine release\\.\n\nC\\. Substance dependence causes structural changes in the brain, while videogaming only affects functional behaviour without biological traces\\.\n\nD\\. Videogaming addiction is strictly psychological, whereas substance dependence is strictly physiological\\.\n\nQ1\\.2 In the context of the reward system, what did the brain imaging study on 'Ecstasy' users and gamers reveal about dopamine receptors?\n\nA\\. Ex\\-chronic users showed a massive increase in dopamine release when playing, unlike the control group\\.\n\nB\\. Healthy controls showed no change in dopamine levels, while ex\\-users showed a decrease\\.\n\nC\\. Healthy controls showed reduced D2 receptor occupancy \\(indicating dopamine release\\), while ex\\-chronic users showed no change due to desensitized receptors\\.\n\nD\\. Both groups showed identical levels of dopamine release, suggesting the reward system is unaffected by past drug use\\.\n\n__2\\. The chicken and egg\u2019s dilemma__\n\nQ2\\.1 In the context of the 'Chicken and Egg' dilemma regarding brain structure and gaming, which of the following represents the 'Egg' perspective?\n\nA\\. Excessive gaming leads to a physical expansion of the ventral striatum over time\\.\n\nB\\. A pre\\-existing brain state, such as a larger dorsal striatum, predisposes individuals to be successful at and attracted to gaming\\.\n\nC\\. Gaming reduces the volume of the hippocampus, forcing the brain to rely on the striatum\\.\n\nD\\. The brain is entirely plastic and shows no pre\\-existing differences between gamers and non\\-gamers\\.\n\nQ2\\.2 According to K\u00fchn et al\\. \\(2011\\), what structural change in the brain is correlated with frequent video game playing?\n\nA\\. A decrease in the volume of the hippocampus\\.\n\nB\\. An enlargement of the left ventral striatum \\(grey matter volume\\)\\.\n\nC\\. A thinning of the prefrontal cortex\\.\n\nD\\. A reduction in the size of the amygdala\\.\n\n__3\\. Dopamine, arousal and autonomic system__\n\nQ3\\.1 According to Metcalf and Pammer \\(2014\\), how do arousal patterns differ between First\\-Person Shooter \\(FPS\\) gamers and addicted MMORPG players?\n\nA\\. Both groups show a continuous increase in physiological arousal throughout the gaming session\\.\n\nB\\. FPS gamers show high arousal during play, whereas excessive MMORPG players display significant decreases in arousal \\(relaxation/escape\\)\\.\n\nC\\. MMORPG players show high arousal due to social interaction, while FPS gamers show low arousal due to repetition\\.\n\nD\\. There is no significant difference; all gamers seek high adrenaline rushes\\.\n\nQ3\\.2 Research by Nicholas Carnagey on the autonomic nervous system suggests that brief exposure to violent videogames leads to:\n\nA\\. A permanent state of heightened anxiety in real\\-life situations\\.\n\nB\\. Physiological desensitisation, where players show less physiological arousal to real\\-life violence\\.\n\nC\\. An increase in cardiac coherence and empathy towards others\\.\n\nD\\. A sharp increase in heart rate and galvanic skin response when viewing subsequent real\\-life violence\\.\n\n__4\\. Behavioural aggression in videogamers__\n\nQ4\\.1 In the study by Konijn et al\\. \\(2007\\), how was aggression measured after participants played violent or non\\-violent games?\n\nA\\. By observing the participants' physical interactions with peers in a playground setting\\.\n\nB\\. By asking participants to rate their current feelings of anger on a questionnaire\\.\n\nC\\. By the intensity and duration of a noise blast the participant chose to administer to a losing opponent\\.\n\nD\\. By the number of violent words used in a subsequent creative writing task\\.\n\nQ4\\.2 What mediates the link between violent video game exposure and increased aggression, according to the study by Hasan, B\u00e8gue, and Bushman \\(2012\\)?\n\nA\\. A decrease in dopamine levels\\.\n\nB\\. The hostile expectation bias \\(the tendency to perceive hostile intent in others\\)\\.\n\nC\\. A reduction in visual acuity and attention span\\.\n\nD\\. The competitive nature of the game regardless of violence\\.\n\n__5\\. Physiological effects of violent videogames__\n\nQ5\\.1 In the experiment by Carnagey et al\\. \\(2007\\), what was the physiological reaction of participants who had played violent games when later watching scenes of real\\-life violence?\n\nA\\. They exhibited higher heart rates and galvanic skin response compared to the non\\-violent game group\\.\n\nB\\. They showed lower heart rates and galvanic skin response, indicating physiological desensitisation\\.\n\nC\\. Their physiological responses were identical to the baseline measurements taken before gaming\\.\n\nD\\. They showed increased cardiac coherence and synchronised breathing\\.\n\nQ5\\.2 According to Hasan et al\\. \\(2012\\), what is the relationship between 'cardiac coherence' and aggression in gamers?\n\nA\\. Violent games increase cardiac coherence, which in turn increases aggression\\.\n\nB\\. Violent games decrease cardiac coherence \\(inducing stress\\), which correlates with higher aggression levels\\.\n\nC\\. Cardiac coherence remains stable regardless of the game type and does not predict aggression\\.\n\nD\\. Non\\-violent games decrease cardiac coherence, leading to frustration and aggression\\.\n\n__6\\. Brain correlates of aggression__\n\nQ6\\.1 According to the fMRI study by Mathiak and Weber \\(2006\\), which brain areas are suppressed \\(less active\\) during violent gaming scenes?\n\nA\\. The dorsal striatum and the motor cortex\\.\n\nB\\. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex \\(rACC\\) and the amygdala\\.\n\nC\\. The visual cortex and the hippocampus\\.\n\nD\\. The ventral striatum and the nucleus accumbens\\.\n\nQ6\\.2 The suppression of the amygdala and rACC during violent gaming is interpreted by researchers as:\n\nA\\. A sign of cognitive decline and loss of memory function\\.\n\nB\\. A mechanism to allow the player to act violently without emotional hesitation or fear\\.\n\nC\\. Evidence that the player is not paying attention to the game content\\.\n\nD\\. A result of visual fatigue from the screen's brightness\\.\n\n__7\\. Effect of gaming on attention__\n\nQ7\\.1 Research by Swing et al\\. \\(2010\\) and Gentile et al\\. \\(2012\\) regarding gaming and attention deficits found that:\n\nA\\. Gaming improves sustained attention, reducing the likelihood of attention problems in school\\.\n\nB\\. There is a bidirectional causality where impulsivity leads to more gaming, and gaming exacerbates attention problems\\.\n\nC\\. Television viewing is a more robust predictor of attention problems than videogames\\.\n\nD\\. Gaming has no significant correlation with teacher\\-reported attention problems\\.\n\nQ7\\.2 Conversely, what positive visual\\-attentional benefit did Green and Bavelier \\(2003\\) and Appelbaum et al\\. \\(2013\\) find in action gamers?\n\nA\\. Improved sustained attention allowing them to focus on slow\\-moving objects for hours\\.\n\nB\\. Enhanced selective attention and visual sensitivity, allowing faster extraction of information from a scene\\.\n\nC\\. Better verbal memory and auditory processing speed\\.\n\nD\\. A reduction in the \"blind spot\" of the visual field\\.\n\n__8\\. Digital world, memory and learning__\n\nQ8\\.1 The concept of 'Transactive Memory', as discussed in the context of the digital world, refers to:\n\nA\\. The ability to transfer memory from short\\-term to long\\-term storage via repetition\\.\n\nB\\. A form of memory where information is stored collectively outside ourselves \\(e\\.g\\., on the Internet\\) rather than internally\\.\n\nC\\. The loss of memory due to excessive multitasking and lack of sleep\\.\n\nD\\. The enhanced ability to memorise visual patterns found in videogames\\.\n\nQ8\\.2 According to the 'Google Effect' research, when people are faced with a gap in their knowledge, they are primed to:\n\nA\\. Ask a friend or colleague for the answer\\.\n\nB\\. Attempt to deduce the answer through logic and reasoning\\.\n\nC\\. Turn to the computer/Internet to rectify the situation\\.\n\nD\\. Ignore the gap and move on to a different topic\\.\n\n__9\\. The Google effect__\n\nQ9\\.1 In Experiment 1 by Sparrow et al\\., how did the modified Stroop task demonstrate the 'Google Effect'?\n\nA\\. Participants were slower to name colours of computer\\-related words \\(e\\.g\\., 'Google'\\) after facing hard trivia questions, indicating these concepts were more accessible\\.\n\nB\\. Participants were faster to name colours of computer\\-related words after easy questions\\.\n\nC\\. Participants completely failed to read computer\\-related words due to cognitive overload\\.\n\nD\\. There was no difference in reaction times between general words and computer\\-related words\\.\n\nQ9\\.2 What was the key finding of Experiment 2 regarding the encoding of information?\n\nA\\. People remember information better if they believe it will be saved on a computer\\.\n\nB\\. People make less effort to remember information if they believe it will be available to look up later\\.\n\nC\\. Reading information on a screen automatically prevents it from being stored in long\\-term memory\\.\n\nD\\. There is no difference in recall between information believed to be erased and information believed to be saved\\.\n\n__10\\. \"What\" vs \"Where\"__\n\nQ10\\.1 In Experiment 4 by Sparrow et al\\., when participants typed trivia statements into folders, what did they recall best?\n\nA\\. They recalled the content of the trivia statements better than the folder locations\\.\n\nB\\. They recalled the folder names \\(where the info was\\) better than the information itself\\.\n\nC\\. They recalled neither the information nor the locations due to digital amnesia\\.\n\nD\\. They recalled the information only if it was saved in a folder named \"Important\"\\.\n\nQ10\\.2 The overall conclusion of the Sparrow et al\\. studies on the Google Effect is that:\n\nA\\. The internet is destroying our capacity for any form of memory\\.\n\nB\\. We are adapting our memory to prioritise 'where' to find information over 'what' the information is\\.\n\nC\\. Human memory is incapable of adapting to new technological tools\\.\n\nD\\. We only remember information that is presented in a 3D environment\\.\n\n__Neurobiological Mechanisms of Placebo and Nocebo__\n\n__1\\. Clinical Trials vs Scientific Research__\n\nQ1\\.1 According to the slides, what is the primary aim regarding the placebo effect in the context of clinical trials?\n\nA\\.

To understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the placebo response\\.\n\nD\\. To replace active medication with placebos to save costs\\.\n\nQ1\\.2 How does the aim of clinical practice differ from that of clinical trials regarding the placebo effect?\n\nA\\. Clinical practice aims to eliminate the placebo effect entirely\\.\n\nB\\. Clinical practice aims to ignore the placebo effect and focus only on surgery\\.\n\nC\\. Clinical practice aims to increase the placebo effect to benefit the patient\\.\n\nD\\. Clinical practice aims to use the placebo effect only for diagnostic purposes\\.\n\n__2\\.

It is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat depression in placebo non\\-responders\\.\n\nQ2\\.2 Does Naloxone block the placebo effect only in humans?\n\nA\\. Yes, the placebo effect is a strictly human cognitive phenomenon involving complex language\\.\n\nB\\. No, the study by Guo et al\\. \\(2010\\) showed that Naloxone blocks placebo analgesia in mice as well\\.\n\nC\\. No, but in animals, it only works if the placebo is induced by social learning, not conditioning\\.\n\nD\\. Yes, because animals lack the prefrontal cortex necessary for expectation\\.\n\n__3\\. Proglumide and Pentagastrin__\n\nQ3\\.1 What is the effect of Proglumide on the placebo analgesic response?\n\nA\\. It blocks the placebo effect by antagonising opioid receptors\\.\n\nB\\.

The dopaminergic reward system\\.\n\nQ5\\.2 How can pharmacological blockers reveal specific pathways in placebo analgesia?\n\nA\\. They show that all placebo responses are mediated by dopamine\\.\n\nB\\. They reveal that the pathway depends on the previous exposure: Naloxone blocks opioid\\-induced placebo, while Rimonabant blocks NSAID\\-induced \\(cannabinoid\\) placebo\\.\n\nC\\. They prove that the placebo effect is purely psychological and has no biochemical basis\\.\n\nD\\. They demonstrate that the nocebo effect is simply the absence of the placebo effect\\.\n\n__6\\. Role of ACC and Prefrontal Lobe__\n\nQ6\\.1 What role does the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex \\(DLPFC\\) play in placebo analgesia?\n\nA\\.

Conditioning Protocol and Fatigue__\n\nQ8\\.1 According to Pollo et al\\. \\(2008, 2010\\), how do 'Expectation' and 'Conditioning' differ in their effect on fatigue?\n\nA\\. Verbal expectation alone is sufficient to significantly reduce perceived fatigue\\.\n\nB\\. Neither expectation nor conditioning can reduce physical fatigue\\.\n\nC\\. Conditioning is required to reduce perceived fatigue; expectation alone increases the number of repetitions but does not lower fatigue levels\\.\n\nD\\. Expectation reduces fatigue, while conditioning only increases muscle force\\.\n\nQ8\\.2 What is the typical conditioning protocol used in these motor placebo paradigms?\n\nA\\. Giving the patient a caffeine drink before every session without any trick\\.\n\nB\\. Surreptitiously reducing the load to lift during training sessions to create an association between the \"treatment\" and ease of movement\\.\n\nC\\. Using electrical stimulation to force muscle contraction during the placebo phase\\.\n\nD\\. Telling the patient that the task is impossible to perform\\.\n\n__9\\. Immunosuppression and Hormonal Changes__\n\nQ9\\.1 What was the main finding of the study by Goebel et al\\. \\(2002\\) regarding immunosuppression?\n\nA\\. The immune system is autonomous and cannot be conditioned\\.\n\nB\\. A flavoured drink paired with Cyclosporine A could later induce a reduction in IL\\-2 and IFN\\-gamma levels even when given with a placebo\\.\n\nC\\. Placebo effects are only visible in subjective symptoms, not in biological markers like interleukin levels\\.\n\nD\\. The nocebo effect caused an allergic reaction to the strawberry milk\\.\n\nQ9\\.2 In the study on hormonal changes \\(Benedetti et al\\., 2003\\), what happened to Growth Hormone \\(GH\\) and cortisol levels?\n\nA\\. Verbal suggestion alone was enough to alter hormone levels significantly\\.\n\nB\\. Placebo administration mimicked the effect of Sumatriptan \\(increasing GH and decreasing cortisol\\) only after conditioning? No, the slides suggest placebo mimics the drug effect, but verify if conditioning was explicit\\. Correction based on slide 45/46 : Placebo mimicked Sumatriptan, while verbal suggestion alone did not change concentrations\\.\n\nC\\. Placebo increased cortisol and decreased GH, opposite to the drug\\.\n\nD\\. Hormonal levels remained constant across all groups\\.\n\n__10\\. PET Studies and Dopamine \\(de la Fuente\\-Fernandez\\)__\n\nQ10\\.1 What is Raclopride, used in PET studies on Parkinson's Disease?\n\nA\\. A dopamine agonist that treats the disease\\.\n\nB\\. A radiotracer that competes with endogenous dopamine for D2 and D3 receptors\\.\n\nC\\. A blood\\-flow marker used in fMRI\\.\n\nD\\. An enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the synaptic cleft\\.\n\nQ10\\.2 According to de la Fuente\\-Fernandez et al\\. \\(2001\\), how is dopamine release spatially differentiated in the striatum?\n\nA\\. Clinical improvement is associated with the dorsal striatum, while the expectation of benefit is associated with the ventral striatum\\.\n\nB\\. Clinical improvement is associated with the ventral striatum, while expectation is associated with the dorsal striatum\\.\n\nC\\. Both clinical improvement and expectation release dopamine only in the nucleus accumbens\\.\n\nD\\. Dopamine release occurs only in the substantia nigra, not the striatum\\.\n\n__11\\. Conditioning Strength and Duration__\n\nQ11\\.1 According to Benedetti et al\\. \\(2016\\), what is the relationship between the number of preconditioning sessions and the placebo response in PD patients?\n\nA\\. There is no relationship; one session is sufficient for a maximal effect\\.\n\nB\\. There is a direct correlation: the more conditioning sessions \\(e\\.g\\., 4 sessions\\), the stronger and more rapid the clinical improvement\\.\n\nC\\. Too much conditioning leads to a reversal of the effect \\(nocebo\\)\\.\n\nD\\. Conditioning affects rigidity but not neuronal firing rates\\.\n\nQ11\\.2 How long did the effects of strong conditioning \\(Placebo 4 group\\) last in the single\\-neuron recording study?\n\nA\\. Only for the duration of the surgery \\(a few minutes\\)\\.\n\nB\\. They persisted for up to 24 hours \\(post\\-surgery days\\)\\.\n\nC\\. They lasted for months, similar to the surgical trial effect\\.\n\nD\\. They disappeared immediately after the verbal suggestion was removed\\.\n\n__RCTs and Psychological Mechanisms of Placebo__\n\n__1\\. Pharmacodynamics vs Pharmacokinetics__\n\nQ1\\.1 What is the definition of pharmacodynamics according to the lecture material?\n\nA\\. The study of how the body absorbs, metabolises, and eliminates a drug\\.\n\nB\\. The study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on the body and their mechanism of action\\.\n\nC\\.

To use the placebo effect as the main therapeutic tool\\.\n\nD\\. To ignore the placebo effect as it is irrelevant to the study\\.\n\n__3\\. Natural Remission__\n\nQ3\\.1 What is natural remission?\n\nA\\. The improvement of symptoms due to the active principle of a drug\\.\n\nB\\. The natural course of a symptom or disease improving in the absence of specific interventions\\.\n\nC\\. A psychological phenomenon where patients please the experimenter\\.\n\nD\\. The worsening of symptoms due to negative expectations\\.\n\nQ3\\.2 Does natural remission occur when a placebo is administered?\n\nA\\. No, natural remission only stops when an intervention is made\\.\n\nB\\. Yes, symptom fluctuation and spontaneous improvement can occur concurrently with placebo administration, often being mistaken for efficacy\\.\n\nC\\. No, the placebo effect completely overrides natural physiological processes\\.\n\nD\\. Only in surgical trials, not in pharmacological ones\\.\n\n__4\\. Regression to the Mean__\n\nQ4\\.1 What is 'regression to the mean'?\n\nA\\. A biological mechanism where the body returns to homeostasis after a shock\\.\n\nB\\. A statistical phenomenon where an extreme variable on first measurement tends to be closer to the average on a second measurement\\.\n\nC\\. A psychological bias where patients report average pain levels to avoid disappointing the doctor\\.\n\nD\\. The process by which a drug loses its potency over time\\.\n\nQ4\\.2 How can regression to the mean affect the interpretation of a clinical trial?\n\nA\\. It proves that the drug is effective if the values decrease\\.\n\nB\\. It acts as a specific factor of the treatment\\.\n\nC\\. It can be mistaken for a therapeutic effect, as extreme symptoms might improve naturally purely due to statistical probability\\.\n\nD\\. It prevents the use of randomised controlled trials\\.\n\n__5\\. Randomisation and Blinding__\n\nQ5\\.1 What distinguishes a randomised clinical trial \\(RCT\\) from a non\\-randomised one?\n\nA\\. In RCTs, the experimenter chooses who gets the drug based on severity; in non\\-randomised, it is random\\.\n\nB\\. In RCTs, the allocation of participants to groups \\(treatment or control\\) is done randomly to reduce bias\\.\n\nC\\. RCTs do not use placebos, whereas non\\-randomised trials do\\.\n\nD\\. RCTs are only used for surgical procedures\\.\n\nQ5\\.2 What is the difference between single\\-blind and double\\-blind studies?\n\nA\\. In single\\-blind, only the patient is unaware of the treatment; in double\\-blind, both the patient and the researcher are unaware\\.\n\nB\\. In single\\-blind, the researcher is unaware; in double\\-blind, the patient knows everything\\.\n\nC\\. Single\\-blind studies use one placebo; double\\-blind studies use two types of placebo\\.\n\nD\\. There is no difference; they are synonyms\\.\n\n__6\\. Gold Standards and Clinical Trial Phases__\n\nQ6\\.1 What characteristics define the 'Gold Standard' of clinical trials?\n\nA\\. Open\\-label, non\\-randomised, and without a control group\\.\n\nB\\.

Phase III\\.\n\nD\\. Phase IV\\.\n\n__7\\. Placebo Effect and Context__\n\nQ7\\.1 How does the lecture define the relationship between the placebo effect and context?\n\nA\\. The placebo effect is independent of the context\\.\n\nB\\. The placebo effect is essentially a 'context effect', influenced by the psychosocial setting, doctor\\-patient relationship, and physical cues\\.\n\nC\\. The context only produces nocebo effects, not placebo effects\\.\n\nD\\. The context is considered a 'specific factor' of the active principle\\.\n\nQ7\\.2 Which of the following contextual factors can influence the therapeutic outcome?\n\nA\\. The colour and shape of the medication \\(physicality\\)\\.\n\nB\\. The verbal information provided by the doctor\\.\n\nC\\. The healthcare setting and architecture\\.\n\nD\\. All of the above\\.\n\n__8\\. Placebo Run\\-in Trials__\n\nQ8\\.1 What is the primary purpose of a 'Placebo run\\-in' phase in a clinical trial?\n\nA\\. To test the safety of the active drug before giving it\\.\n\nB\\. To identify and exclude placebo responders from the subsequent phases of the trial\\.\n\nC\\. To condition the patient to expect a benefit\\.\n\nD\\. To save money on the active drug\\.\n\nQ8\\.2 How is a placebo run\\-in typically conducted?\n\nA\\. All patients receive the active drug first, then the placebo\\.\n\nB\\. A placebo is administered to all participants; those who show a significant improvement \\(responders\\) are removed from the study group\\.\n\nC\\. Patients are told they are getting a placebo to see if they get angry\\.\n\nD\\. It involves giving a double dose of the drug to ensure efficacy\\.\n\n__9\\. Cross\\-over and Balanced Designs__\n\nQ9\\.1 What characterises a 'Cross\\-over' design?\n\nA\\. Patients are randomly assigned to one group and stay there forever\\.\n\nB\\. Patients receive the active treatment in one phase and the placebo in another \\(or vice versa\\), acting as their own controls\\.\n\nC\\. Patients cross over to a different hospital halfway through the study\\.\n\nD\\. It is a design used only for surgical trials\\.\n\nQ9\\.2 What is the 'Balanced Placebo Design' \\(often used to disentangle drug vs expectation effects\\)?\n\nA\\. It involves four groups: Told Drug/Get Drug, Told Drug/Get Placebo, Told Placebo/Get Drug, Told Placebo/Get Placebo\\.\n\nB\\. It involves balancing the number of men and women in the study\\.\n\nC\\. It ensures that the placebo tastes exactly like the drug\\.\n\nD\\. It balances the cost of the trial between the pharmaceutical company and the hospital\\.\n\n__10\\. Open\\-Hidden Paradigm__\n\nQ10\\.1 What is the core concept of the 'Open\\-Hidden' paradigm?\n\nA\\. Comparing the effect of a drug administered with the patient's full knowledge \\(Open\\) versus the same drug administered without the patient knowing \\(Hidden\\)\\.\n\nB\\. Hiding the results of the trial from the public until publication\\.\n\nC\\. Keeping the patient's eyes open or closed during administration\\.\n\nD\\. Giving the drug openly but hiding the side effects\\.\n\nQ10\\.2 What does the difference between the Open and Hidden administration typically represent?\n\nA\\. The pharmacodynamic effect of the drug\\.\n\nB\\. The toxicity of the drug\\.\n\nC\\. The placebo/expectancy component of the treatment\\.\n\nD\\. The regression to the mean\\.\n\n__11\\. Psychological Mechanisms and Bayesian Perspective__\n\nQ11\\.1 According to the slides, what are the two main psychological mechanisms involved in the placebo effect?\n\nA\\. Anxiety and Depression\\.\n\nB\\. Expectation and Conditioning\\.\n\nC\\. Memory and Attention\\.\n\nD\\. Motivation and Reward\\.\n\nQ11\\.2 In the Bayesian perspective of the brain, what is a 'Prediction Error' \\(PE\\)?\n\nA\\. A mistake made by the researcher in data analysis\\.\n\nB\\. The discrepancy between the Prior \\(expectation\\) and the Sensory Input \\(actual experience\\)\\.\n\nC\\. The failure of the brain to generate any expectation\\.\n\nD\\. A cognitive deficit found in placebo non\\-responders\\.\n\n__12\\. Violation of Expectations__\n\nQ12\\.1 According to the ViolEx model, what happens when expectations are violated \\(e\\.g\\., treatment outcome differs from prediction\\)?\n\nA\\. The patient always ignores the outcome\\.\n\nB\\. It can leads to an 'Expectation update' \\(accommodation/learning\\) or to 'Immunisation' \\(maintenance of the prior belief\\)\\.\n\nC\\. The patient immediately develops amnesia regarding the treatment\\.\n\nD\\. The brain stops processing sensory inputs to avoid conflict\\.\n\nQ12\\.2 If a patient has a 'Prior with high certainty' \\(high precision\\), what is likely to happen when they receive contradictory sensory input \\(e\\.g\\. no pain\\)?\n\nA\\. They will immediately update their belief to match the input\\.\n\nB\\. They are more likely to maintain their original expectation \\(Immunisation/Assimilation\\), considering the input as an exception\\.\n\nC\\. The sensory input will always override the prior\\.\n\nD\\. They will develop a new personality trait\\.\n\n__13\\. Classical Conditioning__\n\nQ13\\.1 What is 'Classical Conditioning' in the context of the placebo effect?\n\nA\\. Learning through observation of others\\.\n\nB\\. A neutral stimulus \\(e\\.g\\., a syringe or context\\) being associated with an unconditioned stimulus \\(e\\.g\\., a drug\\) to elicit a conditioned response\\.\n\nC\\. A conscious decision to get better\\.\n\nD\\. The genetic predisposition to respond to sugar pills\\.\n\nQ13\\.2 What are the two main phases of a classical conditioning procedure?\n\nA\\. The 'Acquisition' phase \\(learning the association\\) and the 'Evocation' or 'Recall' phase \\(testing the response to the conditioned stimulus alone\\)\\.\n\nB\\. The 'Randomisation' phase and the 'Analysis' phase\\.\n\nC\\. The 'Open' phase and the 'Hidden' phase\\.\n\nD\\. The 'Placebo' phase and the 'Nocebo' phase\\.\n\n__Answer Key \\(RCTs and Mechanisms\\)__\n\n- Q1\\.1: B, Q1\\.2: A\n- Q2\\.1: C, Q2\\.2: B\n- Q3\\.1: B, Q3\\.2: B\n- Q4\\.1: B, Q4\\.2: C\n- Q5\\.1: B, Q5\\.2: A\n- Q6\\.1: B, Q6\\.2: D\n- Q7\\.1: B, Q7\\.2: D\n- Q8\\.1: B, Q8\\.2: B\n- Q9\\.1: B, Q9\\.2: A\n- Q10\\.1: A, Q10\\.2: C\n- Q11\\.1: B, Q11\\.2: B\n- Q12\\.1: B, Q12\\.2: B\n- Q13\\.1: B, Q13\\.2: A\n\n__Integrated Exam Preparation: Advanced Topics Question Bank__\n\n__1\\. Key Experimental Studies__\n\nQ1\\.1 In the study by Newsome et al\\. \\(1989\\) using the Random Dot Motion task, which specific brain area was found to have a causal link with the monkey's decision regarding motion direction?\n\nA\\. The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex \\(DLPFC\\)\\.\n\nB\\. The Middle Temporal visual area \\(MT/V5\\)\\.\n\nC\\. The Fusiform Face Area \\(FFA\\)\\.\n\nD\\. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex \\(ACC\\)\\.\n\nQ1\\.2 According to Heekeren et al\\. \\(2004\\), how does the brain make a perceptual decision between two categories \\(e\\.g\\., Face vs\\. House\\)?\n\nA\\. The sensory areas \\(FFA/PPA\\) make the decision independently before sending it to the motor cortex\\.\n\nB\\. The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex \\(DLPFC\\) acts as a comparator, integrating the difference in signal strength between the two sensory populations\\.\n\nC\\. The decision is purely emotional and driven by the Amygdala\\.\n\nD\\. The Parietal Lobe filters the visual information and discards the weaker signal immediately\\.\n\nQ1\\.3 The study by Chersi et al\\. highlights the role of the Inferior Parietal Lobule \\(IPL\\) in decision making\\. What is its primary function in this context?\n\nA\\. It is solely responsible for spatial attention\\.\n\nB\\. It encodes the value of the reward\\.\n\nC\\. It organizes action sequences and helps understand the intention behind an observed motor act\\.\n\nD\\. It inhibits impulsive responses\\.\n\n__2\\. Game Theory & Paradoxes__\n\nQ2\\.1 The Allais Paradox is significant in behavioural economics because it demonstrates a violation of the Expected Utility Theory\\. Which specific bias does it reveal?\n\nA\\. The Certainty Effect: individuals disproportionately overweight outcomes that are considered certain \\(100% probability\\)\\.\n\nB\\. The Framing Effect: individuals prefer options presented in a positive light\\.\n\nC\\. The Endowment Effect: individuals value items more simply because they own them\\.\n\nD\\. The Sunk Cost Fallacy: individuals continue a behaviour due to previously invested resources\\.\n\nQ2\\.2 In the Ultimatum Game, a Responder often rejects an \"unfair\" offer \\(e\\.g\\., receiving only 20% of the pot\\)\\. Which brain region is most active during this rejection and correlates with the negative emotional response?\n\nA\\. The Nucleus Accumbens \\(NAcc\\)\\.\n\nB\\. The Anterior Insula\\.\n\nC\\. The Temporoparietal Junction \\(TPJ\\)\\.\n\nD\\. The Motor Cortex\\.\n\nQ2\\.3 In the Prisoner's Dilemma, mutual cooperation is often observed despite the incentive to defect\\. Which brain area is associated with the intrinsic reward of cooperating with another human?\n\nA\\. The Amygdala\\.\n\nB\\. The Ventral Striatum / Nucleus Accumbens\\.\n\nC\\. The visual cortex\\.\n\nD\\. The Hippocampus\\.\n\n__3\\. The Digital Brain__\n\nQ3\\.1 What is the core finding of the \"Google Effect\" \\(Sparrow et al\\.\\) regarding Transactive Memory?\n\nA\\. Digital technology improves our ability to memorise facts and phone numbers\\.\n\nB\\. People tend to forget what the information is, but they have better recall of where the information is stored\\.\n\nC\\. Heavy internet use significantly increases the volume of the Hippocampus\\.\n\nD\\. Search engines have no measurable effect on memory retrieval strategies\\.\n\nQ3\\.2 According to the study by Ophir et al\\. \\(2009\\) on Media Multitasking, how do Heavy Media Multitaskers \\(HMMs\\) compare to Light Media Multitaskers \\(LMMs\\)?\n\nA\\. HMMs are significantly better at task\\-switching and ignoring distractions\\.\n\nB\\. HMMs perform worse on cognitive control tasks because they have a deficit in filtering out irrelevant environmental stimuli\\.\n\nC\\. HMMs have superior working memory capacity\\.\n\nD\\. There is no significant difference in cognitive performance between the two groups\\.\n\nQ3\\.3 Research on social media usage has found a correlation between the frequency of checking Facebook and the volume of a specific brain structure\\. Which one?\n\nA\\. A smaller Nucleus Accumbens \\(associated with reward/addiction\\)\\.\n\nB\\. A larger Amygdala \\(associated with fear\\)\\.\n\nC\\. A thicker Prefrontal Cortex \\(associated with control\\)\\.\n\nD\\. A larger Hippocampus \\(associated with memory\\)\\.\n\nQ3\\.4 Unlike social media, Action Video Games \\(AVGs\\) have been linked to specific cognitive improvements \\(Green & Bavelier\\)\\. Which of the following is NOT one of the improved domains?\n\nA\\. Contrast sensitivity \\(visual acuity\\)\\.\n\nB\\. Visuospatial attention \\(tracking multiple objects\\)\\.\n\nC\\. Empathy and emotional regulation\\.\n\nD\\. Reaction time without loss of accuracy\\.\n\n__4\\. Neurobiology of Placebo__\n\nQ4\\.1 In the study by de la Fuente\\-Fernandez et al\\. \\(2001\\) on Parkinson\u2019s patients, how was dopamine release measured using PET scans and Raclopride?\n\nA\\. A high PET signal meant high dopamine release\\.\n\nB\\. A low PET signal indicated high dopamine release, as endogenous dopamine competed with the radiotracer for receptors\\.\n\nC\\. The PET scan measured blood flow changes, not dopamine\\.\n\nD\\. Raclopride binds directly to the dopamine molecule, increasing the signal\\.\n\nQ4\\.2 What did the study by Goebel et al\\. \\(2002\\) demonstrate regarding the immune system \\(immunosuppression\\)?\n\nA\\. Verbal suggestion alone \\(\"This drink will lower your immune response\"\\) is sufficient to produce immunosuppression\\.\n\nB\\. The immune system cannot be conditioned\\.\n\nC\\. Unconscious physiological functions like the immune system require Classical Conditioning \\(pairing a CS with a US\\) to be modulated; verbal suggestion is ineffective\\.\n\nD\\. Placebo effects on the immune system are mediated solely by the opioid system\\.\n\nQ4\\.3 From a Bayesian perspective, the placebo effect can be described as:\n\nA\\. The brain passively receiving sensory data and analysing it objectively\\.\n\nB\\. Top\\-down \"Priors\" \\(expectations\\) overriding or reinterpreting bottom\\-up sensory data to match the prediction of relief\\.\n\nC\\. A purely random fluctuation in symptoms \\(Regression to the Mean\\)\\.\n\nD\\. A failure of the brain's error\\-detection mechanism\\.\n\nQ4\\.4 Which neurochemical system is known as the \"anti\\-opioid\" system and is primarily responsible for the Nocebo effect \\(hyperalgesia\\)?\n\nA\\.

window.DOC_ANSWERS = "# Neuroeconomics: Questions & Answers\n\n## Module 1: Foundations of Neuroeconomics\n\n### What is price? (ID: M1-Q01)\nPrice is the objective monetary amount required or paid for a good or service. It is the numerical value assigned to an offer by the seller and represents the exchange ratio between the good and money. Price is an external constraint on the consumer's budget set and is distinct from internal preferences.\n\n### What is cost? (ID: M1-Q02)\nCost refers to the expenditure required to produce or procure a good or service, including labor, materials, capital, and overhead. While price is what the consumer pays, cost is what the producer sacrifices to create the offer.\n\n### What is value? (ID: M1-Q03)\nValue reflects the subjective worth or usefulness an individual assigns to a good or service. Unlike price (market determined) and cost (production determined), value depends on the utility the decision-maker derives from consumption. Neuroeconomically, subjective value is encoded in regions such as vmPFC and OFC, creating a common currency for comparing disparate goods.\n\n### What is the utility function? (ID: M1-Q04)\nA utility function \\(U\\) assigns numeric scores to possible outcomes or bundles of goods so that if option A is preferred to option B, then \\(U(A) > U(B)\\). This allows decisions to be modeled as expected utility maximization problems.\n\n### What is the Allais Paradox? (ID: M1-Q05)\nThe Allais Paradox exposes systematic violations of the Independence Axiom of Expected Utility Theory. People show a certainty effect, preferring a sure outcome (for example, a guaranteed 3,000 GBP) over an 80% chance of 4,000 GBP, yet reversing preferences when probabilities are proportionally reduced (20% vs. 25%), contradicting linear probability weighting.\n\n### What is Kahneman and Tversky's framing theory and what did they discover? (ID: M1-Q06)\nProspect Theory demonstrates that decision-makers react differently when identical options are framed as gains versus losses. People tend to be risk-averse in the gain domain and risk-seeking in the loss domain, implying a value function that is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses (loss aversion).\n\n### What are the characteristics of game theory experiments? (ID: M1-Q07)\nStrategic experiments include interdependent payoffs, explicit rules that constrain actions and information, payoff matrices specifying rewards, and strategic reasoning in which participants form beliefs about others' likely moves (higher-order beliefs).\n\n### What are Prisoner's Dilemma games and what are the early findings? (ID: M1-Q08)\nTwo players simultaneously choose to cooperate or defect. Mutual cooperation produces a moderate payoff, mutual defection yields less, and unilateral defection offers the best individual payoff (temptation) while leaving the cooperator with the worst payoff. The Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, but empirically cooperation rates are high, especially in iterated games where reputation and reciprocity emerge.\n\n### What are Ultimatum Games and what are the key results? (ID: M1-Q09)\nIn the Ultimatum Game, a proposer suggests a split of a sum and a responder accepts or rejects it. Classical theory predicts the responder should accept any positive offer, yet humans often reject offers below 20-30 percent to punish unfairness. Neuroimaging links rejections to anterior insula activity associated with negative affect.\n\n### What is the difference between macroeconomics and microeconomics? (ID: M1-Q10)\nMicroeconomics analyzes individual agents (households, firms) and specific markets. Macroeconomics studies aggregate variables such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, and policy at the scale of the overall economy.\n\n### What are the founding elements of neuroeconomics? (ID: M1-Q11)\nNeuroeconomics integrates neuroscience (measurement and manipulation of brain activity), economics (formal models of choice and games), and psychology (cognitive processes, heuristics, and biases).\n\n### What is the difference between descriptive and normative theories? Is neuroeconomics descriptive, normative, or mixed? (ID: M1-Q12)\nNormative theories prescribe how rational agents should decide (for example, Expected Utility). Descriptive theories explain how agents actually behave, capturing biases (for example, Prospect Theory). Neuroeconomics is mixed but strongly descriptive, as it builds biologically plausible accounts of observed behavior while referencing normative models as benchmarks.\n\n### What are the stages of the decision process? (ID: M1-Q13)\nStandard models (Rangel, Camerer, Montague) include: representation of the problem, valuation of options, action selection, outcome evaluation, and learning (updating values via prediction errors).\n\n### What is the difference between spatial and temporal resolution, and which instruments excel at each? (ID: M1-Q14)\nSpatial resolution indicates where activity occurs; fMRI provides millimeter precision. Temporal resolution indicates when activity occurs; EEG and MEG provide millisecond precision.\n\n### What is the difference between static and dynamic measurements? (ID: M1-Q15)\nStatic measurements capture structure at a single time point (for example, anatomical MRI, CT). Dynamic measurements record functional changes during tasks (for example, fMRI BOLD signals, EEG waveforms).\n\n### What are the main methods used for exploring neuroeconomics and what are their pros and cons? (ID: M1-Q16)\nfMRI offers excellent spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution and indirect (hemodynamic) signals. EEG/ERP provides excellent temporal resolution but poor spatial localization. TMS enables causal inference via temporary disruption yet is limited to cortical surface and may be uncomfortable. Single-unit recordings yield the highest precision but are invasive and largely confined to animal studies.\n\n### What is the Chersi et al. study and what is the IPL role? (ID: M1-Q17)\nChersi et al. examined action organization, showing inferior parietal lobe neurons code goal-dependent motor acts: the same grasping movement evokes different neuronal responses depending on the ultimate intention (eating versus placing).\n\n### What is the Newsome (1989) study and what is the perceptual discrimination task? (ID: M1-Q18)\nNewsome used a random-dot kinematogram task requiring monkeys to report motion direction. Neurons in MT (sensory) and LIP (association) accumulated evidence, linking neural firing to decision accuracy and revealing a neural basis for perceptual decision-making.\n\n### What are diffusion models and which brain areas are involved? (ID: M1-Q19)\nDrift-diffusion models treat decisions as noisy evidence accumulation toward a bound. LIP and dlPFC neurons appear to encode the decision variable as ramping firing rates until a threshold triggers a choice.\n\n### What is the Heekeren et al. (2004) study and what are the roles of ventral temporal cortex and dlPFC? (ID: M1-Q20)\nIn face versus house discrimination tasks, category-selective ventral temporal regions encode sensory evidence (FFA for faces, PPA for places), while dlPFC activity correlates with the evidence difference, acting as a comparator. The study was correlational, so causality was not proven without additional lesion or stimulation data.\n\n### How do dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic signals modulate OFC value representations and routing toward PFC regions? (ID: M1-Q21)\nDopamine conveys reward prediction error and incentive salience, biasing go pathways. Serotonin modulates cost assessment, impulse control, and patience. Acetylcholine adjusts attention and learning rates. Their combined influence shapes whether OFC value information is routed toward medial PFC for execution or lateral PFC for deliberation.\n\n### How can amygdala and hippocampus reshape dorsal prefrontal flow and downstream planning? (ID: M1-Q22)\nAmygdala inputs convey emotional valence (threat, safety) and hippocampal inputs provide contextual memory. These limbic projections target medial PFC, which can override dlPFC-driven planning streams to premotor and parietal regions, biasing action selection toward survival-driven behaviors such as avoidance or freezing.\n\n### How do cortico\u2013basal ganglia loops interact with sensory \u2192 OFC \u2192 PFC \u2192 premotor/parietal pathways, and what if dopamine is dysregulated? (ID: M1-Q23)\nOFC and PFC generate candidate actions whose selection is gated by basal ganglia direct (Go) and indirect (No-Go) loops. Dopamine facilitates the direct pathway and suppresses the indirect pathway. Excess dopamine (for example, addiction) over-facilitates Go signals, whereas dopamine deficits (for example, Parkinson's disease) impede action initiation.\n\n### What is the main role of the NAcc? (ID: M1-Q24)\nThe nucleus accumbens encodes reward anticipation and incentive salience, integrating dopaminergic signals to energize approach behavior toward desired stimuli.\n\n### What are the Tobler et al. study's discoveries? (ID: M1-Q25)\nTobler et al. showed that lateral PFC represents both expected value and risk (variance). While striatum tracks pure value, lPFC signals the spread of outcomes, indicating cortical integration of risk into value computation.\n\n### What are the Knutson et al. findings? (ID: M1-Q26)\nKnutson demonstrated a dissociation between gain and loss anticipation: NAcc activity scales with anticipated gains, whereas anterior insula activity scales with anticipated losses and risk.\n\n### What is the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)? (ID: M1-Q27)\nOFC encodes a common-currency subjective value for options independent of their sensory features or required actions, enabling comparisons among disparate goods.\n\n### What are the main findings of Padoa-Schioppa studies? (ID: M1-Q28)\nSingle neurons in monkey OFC encode the subjective economic value of offered and chosen goods (quantity multiplied by preference), invariant to spatial location or motor response, indicating OFC computes goods-based rather than action-based value.\n\n### How do lesion studies help infer brain function? (ID: M1-Q29)\nLesion research leverages dissociations: if damage to area X impairs function A but spares function B, while damage to area Y impairs function B, causality is inferred for each region-function pair. This method establishes necessity beyond correlational imaging.\n\n### What happens in patients with vmPFC impairment? (ID: M1-Q30)\nPatients retain intellect and memory but show profound socio-emotional decision deficits. They fail to integrate somatic markers, leading to maladaptive real-life choices and poor Iowa Gambling Task performance.\n\n### What is the role of dlPFC and what happens when it is disrupted? (ID: M1-Q31)\ndlPFC supports executive control, working memory, and rule maintenance. Disruption (lesion or TMS) causes impulsivity, difficulty sustaining task rules, and degraded planning.\n\n### What is the role of ACC and what about the ERN? (ID: M1-Q32)\nACC monitors conflict and detects errors. The error-related negativity (ERN) is an ACC-generated ERP component occurring within milliseconds of an error, signaling the need for increased cognitive control.\n\n## Module 3: Environment, Plasticity, and Technology\n\n### What are enriched environments? (ID: M3-Q01)\nEnriched environments provide enhanced sensory, cognitive, motor, and social stimulation relative to standard laboratory housing (for example, wheels, tunnels, nesting material, group housing), promoting neuroplasticity.\n\n### What did van Dellen discover with enriched environments in Huntington's chorea models? (ID: M3-Q02)\nMouse models of Huntington's disease kept in enriched environments exhibited delayed motor symptom onset and slower progression. Enrichment rescued deficits in proteins such as BDNF, indicating lifestyle can modulate genetic neurodegenerative trajectories.\n\n### What is the London Taxi Drivers experiment and what are the findings? (ID: M3-Q03)\nMaguire et al. compared licensed taxi drivers (who master \"The Knowledge\") to controls. Taxi drivers showed larger posterior hippocampi and smaller anterior hippocampi, with posterior volume scaling with years of experience, demonstrating adult structural plasticity driven by spatial navigation demands.\n\n### What do musicians and mathematicians' studies teach us? (ID: M3-Q04)\nExperience-dependent plasticity: professional musicians exhibit increased gray matter in motor, auditory, and visuospatial cortex; mathematicians show increased density in parietal areas involved in arithmetic. The brain structurally adapts to cognitive load.\n\n### What is the like effect and what is the NAcc role? (ID: M3-Q05)\nReceiving social validation (likes) recruits the ventral striatum/NAcc, engaging dopamine-mediated reward circuitry similar to primary rewards and reinforcing online engagement.\n\n### What is the dopamine effect and what triggers it? (ID: M3-Q06)\nDopamine reinforces behavior by signaling reward prediction errors. Triggers include unexpected rewards, novelty, and cues predicting rewards (for example, notification sounds), driving the wanting component of motivation.\n\n### What is the Seltzer et al. (2012) study and what are the endocrine impacts of tech-mediated communication? (ID: M3-Q07)\nAfter stress induction, girls either texted, spoke by phone, met in person, or had no contact with their mothers. Texting produced cortisol and oxytocin patterns indistinguishable from no contact, whereas hearing the voice or meeting reduced cortisol and increased oxytocin, showing text-only communication fails to engage biological social-soothing mechanisms.\n\n### What are videogaming's effects on the reward system and what is the craving hypothesis? (ID: M3-Q08)\nGaming evokes strong dopamine release in the striatum. Over time, cues associated with gaming become conditioned stimuli that alone elicit striatal activation and craving, mirroring substance addiction dynamics.\n\n### What is the chicken-and-egg dilemma in gaming neuroscience and which brain areas are involved? (ID: M3-Q09)\nThe dilemma asks whether brain differences predispose individuals to gaming or whether gaming reshapes the brain. Evidence supports both: gaming drives gray-matter growth in striatum and dlPFC, while baseline ventral striatum measures can predict vulnerability to gaming addiction.\n\n### What is the link between dopamine, arousal, and videogaming; how do FPS and MMORPG titles differ; and what are repetition effects on the autonomic system? (ID: M3-Q10)\nGaming heightens arousal and dopamine. First-person shooters induce high autonomic arousal (heart rate, blood pressure) and vigilance, whereas MMORPGs can elicit lower arousal yet strong social reward and flow states. Repeated exposure, especially to violent content, desensitizes the autonomic system, blunting responses to violence.\n\n### What is the level of behavioral aggression in videogamers? (ID: M3-Q11)\nViolent game play increases aggressive thoughts and short-term laboratory measures (for example, noise blast tasks). Evidence for long-term increases in real-world violence is mixed, so the effect is often characterized as aggression priming rather than causation.\n\n### What are the physiological effects of violent videogames? (ID: M3-Q12)\nAcute effects include heightened sympathetic activation (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance). Chronic exposure can lead to physiological desensitization to violent stimuli.\n\n### What are the brain correlates of aggression? (ID: M3-Q13)\nAggression correlates with hyperactivity in amygdala circuits (threat detection) and hypoactivity in prefrontal regions (OFC/ACC) responsible for top-down inhibition.\n\n### What is the effect of gaming on attention and what are the benefits versus deficits? (ID: M3-Q14)\nAction gamers exhibit superior visual selective attention, faster reaction times, and better multiple-object tracking. However, high gaming frequency correlates with impulsivity and difficulty sustaining attention in low-stimulation settings, potentially exacerbating ADHD-like traits.\n\n### What are the effects of the digital world on memory and learning? (ID: M3-Q15)\nDigital environments promote shallow processing and multitasking, reducing deep encoding and leading to fragmented learning outcomes.\n\n### What is the Google effect, what study identified it, and what are the implications? (ID: M3-Q16)\nSparrow et al. (2011) showed people are less likely to remember information if they believe it is stored online, but they readily remember where to find it. This shift toward transactive memory offloads storage to digital systems.\n\n### What is the difference between remembering \"what\" versus \"where\" and what can be concluded? (ID: M3-Q17)\nWhile recall of content (\"what\") declines when external storage is trusted, recall of the retrieval path (\"where\") improves. The brain optimizes for efficient access rather than retention when reliable external memory exists.\n\n## Module 4: Clinical Trials and Placebo\n\n### What are clinical trials? (ID: M4-Q01)\nClinical trials are controlled studies on human participants that evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dosing of medical, surgical, or behavioral interventions, forming the evidence base for regulatory approvals.\n\n### What is Naloxone and does it work only in humans? (ID: M4-Q02)\nNaloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that blocks endogenous and exogenous opioids. It reverses opioid overdoses and blocks opioid-mediated placebo analgesia in both humans and animals, demonstrating the biological basis of placebo responses.\n\n### What are proglumide and pentagastrin? (ID: M4-Q03)\nProglumide is a cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist that blocks CCK-mediated anxiety and nocebo responses. Pentagastrin is a synthetic peptide that stimulates CCK receptors and can induce anxiety-related physiological effects.\n\n### What about cannabinoid receptors and what is rimonabant? (ID: M4-Q04)\nEndocannabinoid receptors (CB1/CB2) contribute to non-opioid analgesia. Rimonabant is a CB1 antagonist that blocks conditioning-induced placebo analgesia, particularly when conditioning involves non-opioid analgesics such as NSAIDs.\n\n### What are placebo and nocebo effects, and how do blockers reveal neurochemical pathways? (ID: M4-Q05)\nPlacebo effects are beneficial outcomes driven by expectations or conditioning, while nocebo effects are adverse outcomes driven by negative expectations. Pharmacological blockers dissociate mechanisms: naloxone blocks expectation-based (opioid) placebo analgesia, rimonabant blocks conditioning-based (cannabinoid) placebo analgesia, and proglumide blocks CCK-mediated nocebo hyperalgesia.\n\n### What is the role of ACC, prefrontal lobe, and dlPFC? (ID: M4-Q06)\nACC encodes the affective component of pain and shows reduced activity in placebo analgesia and increased activity in nocebo states. Prefrontal regions generate and maintain expectations. dlPFC is critical for sustaining belief; disrupting it with TMS abolishes placebo benefits by preventing top-down expectancy maintenance.\n\n### What is the motor placebo? (ID: M4-Q07)\nIn Parkinson's disease, merely believing medication was administered can improve motor performance (speed, rigidity) via endogenous dopamine release in the striatum, mimicking pharmacological effects.\n\n### What is the conditioning protocol in placebo paradigms and do fatigue levels remain constant? (ID: M4-Q08)\nA neutral cue (future placebo) is paired repeatedly with an active drug (unconditioned stimulus) until the cue alone elicits the physiological response. In exercise studies, placebo caffeine reduces perceived fatigue and increases output even when physiological fatigue markers remain high.\n\n### What is immunosuppression and what did Goebel et al. (2002) find? What are the hormonal changes? (ID: M4-Q09)\nImmunosuppression reduces immune efficacy. Goebel paired a novel drink (conditioned stimulus) with cyclosporine A (unconditioned stimulus) and later showed the drink alone decreased IL-2 and interferon-gamma levels. The effect is mediated via sympathetic pathways (for example, epinephrine linking brain and spleen).\n\n### What did de la Fuente-Fernandez et al. (2001) show, what is raclopride, and how do expectation versus clinical improvement differ? (ID: M4-Q10)\nUsing PET with raclopride (a D2-binding radiotracer displaced by endogenous dopamine), they observed placebo-induced dopamine release in Parkinson's patients. Ventral striatum release correlated with expectation of benefit, while dorsal striatum release correlated with actual motor improvement.\n\n### What is the correlation between conditioning and placebo strength/duration? (ID: M4-Q11)\nConditioning yields stronger and longer-lasting placebo responses than verbal suggestion alone because learned associations engrain physiological responses more deeply.\n\n### What is the difference between pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics? (ID: M4-Q12)\nPharmacokinetics studies what the body does to a drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). Pharmacodynamics studies what the drug does to the body (receptor binding, signal transduction, therapeutic effects).\n\n### For what is the placebo administered? (ID: M4-Q13)\nIn clinical trials it serves as a control to isolate the specific efficacy of the active treatment. In limited clinical practice scenarios (ethically debated) it can harness psychobiological healing mechanisms for symptoms such as pain or anxiety.\n\n### What is natural remission and does it occur when administering placebos? (ID: M4-Q14)\nNatural remission is spontaneous improvement due to the body's own recovery or disease cycles. It occurs regardless of treatment, so observed placebo effects combine true psychobiological effects, natural remission, and regression to the mean.\n\n### What is regression to the mean? (ID: M4-Q15)\nExtreme symptom measurements tend to move toward the average upon retesting. Because patients seek care when symptoms peak, they are statistically likely to improve on the next measurement independent of treatment.\n\n### What is the difference between non-randomized and randomized clinical trials, and between single and double blinding? (ID: M4-Q16)\nRandomized trials assign participants by chance to eliminate selection bias; non-randomized trials assign by choice or convenience, increasing bias. Single-blind designs hide treatment from participants only, while double-blind designs hide it from both participants and investigators, forming the gold standard.\n\n### What are the gold standards of neuroeconomics clinical trials and what are the phases? (ID: M4-Q17)\nGold-standard trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Phases progress from safety and dosage (Phase I) to efficacy and side effects (Phase II), large-scale comparisons with standard of care (Phase III), and post-marketing surveillance (Phase IV).\n\n### How does the placebo effect correlate with context? (ID: M4-Q18)\nPlacebo magnitude scales with contextual cues: invasive delivery (injections) beats pills, high-price branding beats cheap generics, and confident, warm clinician interactions beat cold or uncertain ones.\n\n### What are placebo run-in trials? (ID: M4-Q19)\nBefore the main trial, all participants receive placebo. High placebo responders may be excluded to reduce noise, though this practice is controversial because it limits generalizability.\n\n### What is a cross-over design and what is a balanced design? (ID: M4-Q20)\nIn cross-over studies, each participant receives multiple treatments separated by washout periods, serving as their own control. Balanced designs randomize the order (for example, group AB vs. BA) to neutralize order effects.\n\n### What is the open-hidden paradigm? (ID: M4-Q21)\nThe paradigm compares openly administered drugs (drug plus expectation) with hidden infusions (drug only). The difference between open and hidden conditions estimates the pure expectation component of the placebo effect.\n\n### Which psychological mechanisms underlie the placebo effect and what is the Bayesian perspective? (ID: M4-Q22)\nExpectation and classical conditioning drive placebo responses. A Bayesian perspective views perception as combining priors (beliefs) with sensory evidence; strong priors created by placebo contexts bias the posterior perception toward relief even when sensory evidence is weak.\n\n### What happens when expectations are violated? (ID: M4-Q23)\nUnexpected negative outcomes generate large prediction errors that update internal models and extinguish placebo responses in future encounters.\n\n### What is classical conditioning and what are its phases? (ID: M4-Q24)\nClassical conditioning is associative learning where a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) predicts a biologically potent unconditioned stimulus (US). Phases include acquisition (CS paired with US), extinction (CS presented without US, response weakens), and spontaneous recovery (response briefly reappears after a rest period, indicating suppression rather than erasure).\n";
