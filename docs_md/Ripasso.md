A\. The sensory areas \(FFA/PPA\) make the decision independently before sending it to the motor cortex\.

B\. The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex \(DLPFC\) acts as a comparator, integrating the difference in signal strength between the two sensory populations\.

C\. The decision is purely emotional and driven by the Amygdala\.

D\. The Parietal Lobe filters the visual information and discards the weaker signal immediately\.

Q1\.3 The study by Chersi et al\. highlights the role of the Inferior Parietal Lobule \(IPL\) in decision making\. What is its primary function in this context?

A\. It is solely responsible for spatial attention\.

B\. It encodes the value of the reward\.

C\. It organizes action sequences and helps understand the intention behind an observed motor act\.

D\. It inhibits impulsive responses\.

__2\. Game Theory & Paradoxes__

Q2\.1 The Allais Paradox is significant in behavioural economics because it demonstrates a violation of the Expected Utility Theory\. Which specific bias does it reveal?

A\. The Certainty Effect: individuals disproportionately overweight outcomes that are considered certain \(100% probability\)\.

B\. The Framing Effect: individuals prefer options presented in a positive light\.

C\. The Endowment Effect: individuals value items more simply because they own them\.

D\. The Sunk Cost Fallacy: individuals continue a behaviour due to previously invested resources\.

Q2\.2 In the Ultimatum Game, a Responder often rejects an "unfair" offer \(e\.g\., receiving only 20% of the pot\)\. Which brain region is most active during this rejection and correlates with the negative emotional response?

A\. The Nucleus Accumbens \(NAcc\)\.

B\. The Anterior Insula\.

C\. The Temporoparietal Junction \(TPJ\)\.

D\. The Motor Cortex\.

Q2\.3 In the Prisoner's Dilemma, mutual cooperation is often observed despite the incentive to defect\. Which brain area is associated with the intrinsic reward of cooperating with another human?

A\. The Amygdala\.

B\. The Ventral Striatum / Nucleus Accumbens\.

C\. The visual cortex\.

D\. The Hippocampus\.

__3\. The Digital Brain__

Q3\.1 What is the core finding of the "Google Effect" \(Sparrow et al\.\) regarding Transactive Memory?

A\. Digital technology improves our ability to memorise facts and phone numbers\.

B\. People tend to forget what the information is, but they have better recall of where the information is stored\.

C\. Heavy internet use significantly increases the volume of the Hippocampus\.

D\. Search engines have no measurable effect on memory retrieval strategies\.

Q3\.2 According to the study by Ophir et al\. \(2009\) on Media Multitasking, how do Heavy Media Multitaskers \(HMMs\) compare to Light Media Multitaskers \(LMMs\)?

A\. HMMs are significantly better at task\-switching and ignoring distractions\.

B\. HMMs perform worse on cognitive control tasks because they have a deficit in filtering out irrelevant environmental stimuli\.

C\. HMMs have superior working memory capacity\.

D\. There is no significant difference in cognitive performance between the two groups\.

Q3\.3 Research on social media usage has found a correlation between the frequency of checking Facebook and the volume of a specific brain structure\. Which one?

A\. A smaller Nucleus Accumbens \(associated with reward/addiction\)\.

B\. A larger Amygdala \(associated with fear\)\.

C\. A thicker Prefrontal Cortex \(associated with control\)\.

D\. A larger Hippocampus \(associated with memory\)\.

Q3\.4 Unlike social media, Action Video Games \(AVGs\) have been linked to specific cognitive improvements \(Green & Bavelier\)\. Which of the following is NOT one of the improved domains?

A\. Contrast sensitivity \(visual acuity\)\.

B\. Visuospatial attention \(tracking multiple objects\)\.

C\. Empathy and emotional regulation\.

D\. Reaction time without loss of accuracy\.

__4\. Neurobiology of Placebo__

Q4\.1 In the study by de la Fuente\-Fernandez et al\. \(2001\) on Parkinson’s patients, how was dopamine release measured using PET scans and Raclopride?

A\. A high PET signal meant high dopamine release\.

B\. A low PET signal indicated high dopamine release, as endogenous dopamine competed with the radiotracer for receptors\.

C\. The PET scan measured blood flow changes, not dopamine\.

D\. Raclopride binds directly to the dopamine molecule, increasing the signal\.

Q4\.2 What did the study by Goebel et al\. \(2002\) demonstrate regarding the immune system \(immunosuppression\)?

A\. Verbal suggestion alone \("This drink will lower your immune response"\) is sufficient to produce immunosuppression\.

B\. The immune system cannot be conditioned\.

C\. Unconscious physiological functions like the immune system require Classical Conditioning \(pairing a CS with a US\) to be modulated; verbal suggestion is ineffective\.

D\. Placebo effects on the immune system are mediated solely by the opioid system\.

Q4\.3 From a Bayesian perspective, the placebo effect can be described as:

A\. The brain passively receiving sensory data and analysing it objectively\.

B\. Top\-down "Priors" \(expectations\) overriding or reinterpreting bottom\-up sensory data to match the prediction of relief\.

C\. A purely random fluctuation in symptoms \(Regression to the Mean\)\.

D\. A failure of the brain's error\-detection mechanism\.

Q4\.4 Which neurochemical system is known as the "anti\-opioid" system and is primarily responsible for the Nocebo effect \(hyperalgesia\)?

A\. The Endocannabinoid system\.

B\. The Cholecystokinin \(CCK\) system\.

C\. The Dopaminergic system\.

D\. The Serotonergic system\.

Q4\.5 Anatomically, which brain region acts as the "pivot point" that translates prefrontal expectations into the release of endogenous opioids in the brainstem \(PAG\)?

A\. The Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex \(rACC\)\.

B\. The Occipital Lobe\.

C\. The Cerebellum\.

D\. The Primary Motor Cortex \(M1\)\.
