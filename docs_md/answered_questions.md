# Neuroeconomics: Questions & Answers

## Module 1: Foundations of Neuroeconomics

### What is price? (ID: M1-Q01)
Price is the objective monetary amount required or paid for a good or service. It is the numerical value assigned to an offer by the seller and represents the exchange ratio between the good and money. Price is an external constraint on the consumer's budget set and is distinct from internal preferences.

### What is cost? (ID: M1-Q02)
Cost refers to the expenditure required to produce or procure a good or service, including labor, materials, capital, and overhead. While price is what the consumer pays, cost is what the producer sacrifices to create the offer.

### What is value? (ID: M1-Q03)
Value reflects the subjective worth or usefulness an individual assigns to a good or service. Unlike price (market determined) and cost (production determined), value depends on the utility the decision-maker derives from consumption. Neuroeconomically, subjective value is encoded in regions such as vmPFC and OFC, creating a common currency for comparing disparate goods.

### What is the utility function? (ID: M1-Q04)
A utility function \(U\) assigns numeric scores to possible outcomes or bundles of goods so that if option A is preferred to option B, then \(U(A) > U(B)\). This allows decisions to be modeled as expected utility maximization problems.

### What is the Allais Paradox? (ID: M1-Q05)
The Allais Paradox exposes systematic violations of the Independence Axiom of Expected Utility Theory. People show a certainty effect, preferring a sure outcome (for example, a guaranteed 3,000 GBP) over an 80% chance of 4,000 GBP, yet reversing preferences when probabilities are proportionally reduced (20% vs. 25%), contradicting linear probability weighting.

### What is Kahneman and Tversky's framing theory and what did they discover? (ID: M1-Q06)
Prospect Theory demonstrates that decision-makers react differently when identical options are framed as gains versus losses. People tend to be risk-averse in the gain domain and risk-seeking in the loss domain, implying a value function that is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses (loss aversion).

### What are the characteristics of game theory experiments? (ID: M1-Q07)
Strategic experiments include interdependent payoffs, explicit rules that constrain actions and information, payoff matrices specifying rewards, and strategic reasoning in which participants form beliefs about others' likely moves (higher-order beliefs).

### What are Prisoner's Dilemma games and what are the early findings? (ID: M1-Q08)
Two players simultaneously choose to cooperate or defect. Mutual cooperation produces a moderate payoff, mutual defection yields less, and unilateral defection offers the best individual payoff (temptation) while leaving the cooperator with the worst payoff. The Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, but empirically cooperation rates are high, especially in iterated games where reputation and reciprocity emerge.

### What are Ultimatum Games and what are the key results? (ID: M1-Q09)
In the Ultimatum Game, a proposer suggests a split of a sum and a responder accepts or rejects it. Classical theory predicts the responder should accept any positive offer, yet humans often reject offers below 20-30 percent to punish unfairness. Neuroimaging links rejections to anterior insula activity associated with negative affect.

### What is the difference between macroeconomics and microeconomics? (ID: M1-Q10)
Microeconomics analyzes individual agents (households, firms) and specific markets. Macroeconomics studies aggregate variables such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, and policy at the scale of the overall economy.

### What are the founding elements of neuroeconomics? (ID: M1-Q11)
Neuroeconomics integrates neuroscience (measurement and manipulation of brain activity), economics (formal models of choice and games), and psychology (cognitive processes, heuristics, and biases).

### What is the difference between descriptive and normative theories? Is neuroeconomics descriptive, normative, or mixed? (ID: M1-Q12)
Normative theories prescribe how rational agents should decide (for example, Expected Utility). Descriptive theories explain how agents actually behave, capturing biases (for example, Prospect Theory). Neuroeconomics is mixed but strongly descriptive, as it builds biologically plausible accounts of observed behavior while referencing normative models as benchmarks.

### What are the stages of the decision process? (ID: M1-Q13)
Standard models (Rangel, Camerer, Montague) include: representation of the problem, valuation of options, action selection, outcome evaluation, and learning (updating values via prediction errors).

### What is the difference between spatial and temporal resolution, and which instruments excel at each? (ID: M1-Q14)
Spatial resolution indicates where activity occurs; fMRI provides millimeter precision. Temporal resolution indicates when activity occurs; EEG and MEG provide millisecond precision.

### What is the difference between static and dynamic measurements? (ID: M1-Q15)
Static measurements capture structure at a single time point (for example, anatomical MRI, CT). Dynamic measurements record functional changes during tasks (for example, fMRI BOLD signals, EEG waveforms).

### What are the main methods used for exploring neuroeconomics and what are their pros and cons? (ID: M1-Q16)
fMRI offers excellent spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution and indirect (hemodynamic) signals. EEG/ERP provides excellent temporal resolution but poor spatial localization. TMS enables causal inference via temporary disruption yet is limited to cortical surface and may be uncomfortable. Single-unit recordings yield the highest precision but are invasive and largely confined to animal studies.

### What is the Chersi et al. study and what is the IPL role? (ID: M1-Q17)
Chersi et al. examined action organization, showing inferior parietal lobe neurons code goal-dependent motor acts: the same grasping movement evokes different neuronal responses depending on the ultimate intention (eating versus placing).

### What is the Newsome (1989) study and what is the perceptual discrimination task? (ID: M1-Q18)
Newsome used a random-dot kinematogram task requiring monkeys to report motion direction. Neurons in MT (sensory) and LIP (association) accumulated evidence, linking neural firing to decision accuracy and revealing a neural basis for perceptual decision-making.

### What are diffusion models and which brain areas are involved? (ID: M1-Q19)
Drift-diffusion models treat decisions as noisy evidence accumulation toward a bound. LIP and dlPFC neurons appear to encode the decision variable as ramping firing rates until a threshold triggers a choice.

### What is the Heekeren et al. (2004) study and what are the roles of ventral temporal cortex and dlPFC? (ID: M1-Q20)
In face versus house discrimination tasks, category-selective ventral temporal regions encode sensory evidence (FFA for faces, PPA for places), while dlPFC activity correlates with the evidence difference, acting as a comparator. The study was correlational, so causality was not proven without additional lesion or stimulation data.

### How do dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic signals modulate OFC value representations and routing toward PFC regions? (ID: M1-Q21)
Dopamine conveys reward prediction error and incentive salience, biasing go pathways. Serotonin modulates cost assessment, impulse control, and patience. Acetylcholine adjusts attention and learning rates. Their combined influence shapes whether OFC value information is routed toward medial PFC for execution or lateral PFC for deliberation.

### How can amygdala and hippocampus reshape dorsal prefrontal flow and downstream planning? (ID: M1-Q22)
Amygdala inputs convey emotional valence (threat, safety) and hippocampal inputs provide contextual memory. These limbic projections target medial PFC, which can override dlPFC-driven planning streams to premotor and parietal regions, biasing action selection toward survival-driven behaviors such as avoidance or freezing.

### How do cortico–basal ganglia loops interact with sensory → OFC → PFC → premotor/parietal pathways, and what if dopamine is dysregulated? (ID: M1-Q23)
OFC and PFC generate candidate actions whose selection is gated by basal ganglia direct (Go) and indirect (No-Go) loops. Dopamine facilitates the direct pathway and suppresses the indirect pathway. Excess dopamine (for example, addiction) over-facilitates Go signals, whereas dopamine deficits (for example, Parkinson's disease) impede action initiation.

### What is the main role of the NAcc? (ID: M1-Q24)
The nucleus accumbens encodes reward anticipation and incentive salience, integrating dopaminergic signals to energize approach behavior toward desired stimuli.

### What are the Tobler et al. study's discoveries? (ID: M1-Q25)
Tobler et al. showed that lateral PFC represents both expected value and risk (variance). While striatum tracks pure value, lPFC signals the spread of outcomes, indicating cortical integration of risk into value computation.

### What are the Knutson et al. findings? (ID: M1-Q26)
Knutson demonstrated a dissociation between gain and loss anticipation: NAcc activity scales with anticipated gains, whereas anterior insula activity scales with anticipated losses and risk.

### What is the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)? (ID: M1-Q27)
OFC encodes a common-currency subjective value for options independent of their sensory features or required actions, enabling comparisons among disparate goods.

### What are the main findings of Padoa-Schioppa studies? (ID: M1-Q28)
Single neurons in monkey OFC encode the subjective economic value of offered and chosen goods (quantity multiplied by preference), invariant to spatial location or motor response, indicating OFC computes goods-based rather than action-based value.

### How do lesion studies help infer brain function? (ID: M1-Q29)
Lesion research leverages dissociations: if damage to area X impairs function A but spares function B, while damage to area Y impairs function B, causality is inferred for each region-function pair. This method establishes necessity beyond correlational imaging.

### What happens in patients with vmPFC impairment? (ID: M1-Q30)
Patients retain intellect and memory but show profound socio-emotional decision deficits. They fail to integrate somatic markers, leading to maladaptive real-life choices and poor Iowa Gambling Task performance.

### What is the role of dlPFC and what happens when it is disrupted? (ID: M1-Q31)
dlPFC supports executive control, working memory, and rule maintenance. Disruption (lesion or TMS) causes impulsivity, difficulty sustaining task rules, and degraded planning.

### What is the role of ACC and what about the ERN? (ID: M1-Q32)
ACC monitors conflict and detects errors. The error-related negativity (ERN) is an ACC-generated ERP component occurring within milliseconds of an error, signaling the need for increased cognitive control.

## Module 3: Environment, Plasticity, and Technology

### What are enriched environments? (ID: M3-Q01)
Enriched environments provide enhanced sensory, cognitive, motor, and social stimulation relative to standard laboratory housing (for example, wheels, tunnels, nesting material, group housing), promoting neuroplasticity.

### What did van Dellen discover with enriched environments in Huntington's chorea models? (ID: M3-Q02)
Mouse models of Huntington's disease kept in enriched environments exhibited delayed motor symptom onset and slower progression. Enrichment rescued deficits in proteins such as BDNF, indicating lifestyle can modulate genetic neurodegenerative trajectories.

### What is the London Taxi Drivers experiment and what are the findings? (ID: M3-Q03)
Maguire et al. compared licensed taxi drivers (who master "The Knowledge") to controls. Taxi drivers showed larger posterior hippocampi and smaller anterior hippocampi, with posterior volume scaling with years of experience, demonstrating adult structural plasticity driven by spatial navigation demands.

### What do musicians and mathematicians' studies teach us? (ID: M3-Q04)
Experience-dependent plasticity: professional musicians exhibit increased gray matter in motor, auditory, and visuospatial cortex; mathematicians show increased density in parietal areas involved in arithmetic. The brain structurally adapts to cognitive load.

### What is the like effect and what is the NAcc role? (ID: M3-Q05)
Receiving social validation (likes) recruits the ventral striatum/NAcc, engaging dopamine-mediated reward circuitry similar to primary rewards and reinforcing online engagement.

### What is the dopamine effect and what triggers it? (ID: M3-Q06)
Dopamine reinforces behavior by signaling reward prediction errors. Triggers include unexpected rewards, novelty, and cues predicting rewards (for example, notification sounds), driving the wanting component of motivation.

### What is the Seltzer et al. (2012) study and what are the endocrine impacts of tech-mediated communication? (ID: M3-Q07)
After stress induction, girls either texted, spoke by phone, met in person, or had no contact with their mothers. Texting produced cortisol and oxytocin patterns indistinguishable from no contact, whereas hearing the voice or meeting reduced cortisol and increased oxytocin, showing text-only communication fails to engage biological social-soothing mechanisms.

### What are videogaming's effects on the reward system and what is the craving hypothesis? (ID: M3-Q08)
Gaming evokes strong dopamine release in the striatum. Over time, cues associated with gaming become conditioned stimuli that alone elicit striatal activation and craving, mirroring substance addiction dynamics.

### What is the chicken-and-egg dilemma in gaming neuroscience and which brain areas are involved? (ID: M3-Q09)
The dilemma asks whether brain differences predispose individuals to gaming or whether gaming reshapes the brain. Evidence supports both: gaming drives gray-matter growth in striatum and dlPFC, while baseline ventral striatum measures can predict vulnerability to gaming addiction.

### What is the link between dopamine, arousal, and videogaming; how do FPS and MMORPG titles differ; and what are repetition effects on the autonomic system? (ID: M3-Q10)
Gaming heightens arousal and dopamine. First-person shooters induce high autonomic arousal (heart rate, blood pressure) and vigilance, whereas MMORPGs can elicit lower arousal yet strong social reward and flow states. Repeated exposure, especially to violent content, desensitizes the autonomic system, blunting responses to violence.

### What is the level of behavioral aggression in videogamers? (ID: M3-Q11)
Violent game play increases aggressive thoughts and short-term laboratory measures (for example, noise blast tasks). Evidence for long-term increases in real-world violence is mixed, so the effect is often characterized as aggression priming rather than causation.

### What are the physiological effects of violent videogames? (ID: M3-Q12)
Acute effects include heightened sympathetic activation (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance). Chronic exposure can lead to physiological desensitization to violent stimuli.

### What are the brain correlates of aggression? (ID: M3-Q13)
Aggression correlates with hyperactivity in amygdala circuits (threat detection) and hypoactivity in prefrontal regions (OFC/ACC) responsible for top-down inhibition.

### What is the effect of gaming on attention and what are the benefits versus deficits? (ID: M3-Q14)
Action gamers exhibit superior visual selective attention, faster reaction times, and better multiple-object tracking. However, high gaming frequency correlates with impulsivity and difficulty sustaining attention in low-stimulation settings, potentially exacerbating ADHD-like traits.

### What are the effects of the digital world on memory and learning? (ID: M3-Q15)
Digital environments promote shallow processing and multitasking, reducing deep encoding and leading to fragmented learning outcomes.

### What is the Google effect, what study identified it, and what are the implications? (ID: M3-Q16)
Sparrow et al. (2011) showed people are less likely to remember information if they believe it is stored online, but they readily remember where to find it. This shift toward transactive memory offloads storage to digital systems.

### What is the difference between remembering "what" versus "where" and what can be concluded? (ID: M3-Q17)
While recall of content ("what") declines when external storage is trusted, recall of the retrieval path ("where") improves. The brain optimizes for efficient access rather than retention when reliable external memory exists.

## Module 4: Clinical Trials and Placebo

### What are clinical trials? (ID: M4-Q01)
Clinical trials are controlled studies on human participants that evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dosing of medical, surgical, or behavioral interventions, forming the evidence base for regulatory approvals.

### What is Naloxone and does it work only in humans? (ID: M4-Q02)
Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that blocks endogenous and exogenous opioids. It reverses opioid overdoses and blocks opioid-mediated placebo analgesia in both humans and animals, demonstrating the biological basis of placebo responses.

### What are proglumide and pentagastrin? (ID: M4-Q03)
Proglumide is a cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist that blocks CCK-mediated anxiety and nocebo responses. Pentagastrin is a synthetic peptide that stimulates CCK receptors and can induce anxiety-related physiological effects.

### What about cannabinoid receptors and what is rimonabant? (ID: M4-Q04)
Endocannabinoid receptors (CB1/CB2) contribute to non-opioid analgesia. Rimonabant is a CB1 antagonist that blocks conditioning-induced placebo analgesia, particularly when conditioning involves non-opioid analgesics such as NSAIDs.

### What are placebo and nocebo effects, and how do blockers reveal neurochemical pathways? (ID: M4-Q05)
Placebo effects are beneficial outcomes driven by expectations or conditioning, while nocebo effects are adverse outcomes driven by negative expectations. Pharmacological blockers dissociate mechanisms: naloxone blocks expectation-based (opioid) placebo analgesia, rimonabant blocks conditioning-based (cannabinoid) placebo analgesia, and proglumide blocks CCK-mediated nocebo hyperalgesia.

### What is the role of ACC, prefrontal lobe, and dlPFC? (ID: M4-Q06)
ACC encodes the affective component of pain and shows reduced activity in placebo analgesia and increased activity in nocebo states. Prefrontal regions generate and maintain expectations. dlPFC is critical for sustaining belief; disrupting it with TMS abolishes placebo benefits by preventing top-down expectancy maintenance.

### What is the motor placebo? (ID: M4-Q07)
In Parkinson's disease, merely believing medication was administered can improve motor performance (speed, rigidity) via endogenous dopamine release in the striatum, mimicking pharmacological effects.

### What is the conditioning protocol in placebo paradigms and do fatigue levels remain constant? (ID: M4-Q08)
A neutral cue (future placebo) is paired repeatedly with an active drug (unconditioned stimulus) until the cue alone elicits the physiological response. In exercise studies, placebo caffeine reduces perceived fatigue and increases output even when physiological fatigue markers remain high.

### What is immunosuppression and what did Goebel et al. (2002) find? What are the hormonal changes? (ID: M4-Q09)
Immunosuppression reduces immune efficacy. Goebel paired a novel drink (conditioned stimulus) with cyclosporine A (unconditioned stimulus) and later showed the drink alone decreased IL-2 and interferon-gamma levels. The effect is mediated via sympathetic pathways (for example, epinephrine linking brain and spleen).

### What did de la Fuente-Fernandez et al. (2001) show, what is raclopride, and how do expectation versus clinical improvement differ? (ID: M4-Q10)
Using PET with raclopride (a D2-binding radiotracer displaced by endogenous dopamine), they observed placebo-induced dopamine release in Parkinson's patients. Ventral striatum release correlated with expectation of benefit, while dorsal striatum release correlated with actual motor improvement.

### What is the correlation between conditioning and placebo strength/duration? (ID: M4-Q11)
Conditioning yields stronger and longer-lasting placebo responses than verbal suggestion alone because learned associations engrain physiological responses more deeply.

### What is the difference between pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics? (ID: M4-Q12)
Pharmacokinetics studies what the body does to a drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). Pharmacodynamics studies what the drug does to the body (receptor binding, signal transduction, therapeutic effects).

### For what is the placebo administered? (ID: M4-Q13)
In clinical trials it serves as a control to isolate the specific efficacy of the active treatment. In limited clinical practice scenarios (ethically debated) it can harness psychobiological healing mechanisms for symptoms such as pain or anxiety.

### What is natural remission and does it occur when administering placebos? (ID: M4-Q14)
Natural remission is spontaneous improvement due to the body's own recovery or disease cycles. It occurs regardless of treatment, so observed placebo effects combine true psychobiological effects, natural remission, and regression to the mean.

### What is regression to the mean? (ID: M4-Q15)
Extreme symptom measurements tend to move toward the average upon retesting. Because patients seek care when symptoms peak, they are statistically likely to improve on the next measurement independent of treatment.

### What is the difference between non-randomized and randomized clinical trials, and between single and double blinding? (ID: M4-Q16)
Randomized trials assign participants by chance to eliminate selection bias; non-randomized trials assign by choice or convenience, increasing bias. Single-blind designs hide treatment from participants only, while double-blind designs hide it from both participants and investigators, forming the gold standard.

### What are the gold standards of neuroeconomics clinical trials and what are the phases? (ID: M4-Q17)
Gold-standard trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Phases progress from safety and dosage (Phase I) to efficacy and side effects (Phase II), large-scale comparisons with standard of care (Phase III), and post-marketing surveillance (Phase IV).

### How does the placebo effect correlate with context? (ID: M4-Q18)
Placebo magnitude scales with contextual cues: invasive delivery (injections) beats pills, high-price branding beats cheap generics, and confident, warm clinician interactions beat cold or uncertain ones.

### What are placebo run-in trials? (ID: M4-Q19)
Before the main trial, all participants receive placebo. High placebo responders may be excluded to reduce noise, though this practice is controversial because it limits generalizability.

### What is a cross-over design and what is a balanced design? (ID: M4-Q20)
In cross-over studies, each participant receives multiple treatments separated by washout periods, serving as their own control. Balanced designs randomize the order (for example, group AB vs. BA) to neutralize order effects.

### What is the open-hidden paradigm? (ID: M4-Q21)
The paradigm compares openly administered drugs (drug plus expectation) with hidden infusions (drug only). The difference between open and hidden conditions estimates the pure expectation component of the placebo effect.

### Which psychological mechanisms underlie the placebo effect and what is the Bayesian perspective? (ID: M4-Q22)
Expectation and classical conditioning drive placebo responses. A Bayesian perspective views perception as combining priors (beliefs) with sensory evidence; strong priors created by placebo contexts bias the posterior perception toward relief even when sensory evidence is weak.

### What happens when expectations are violated? (ID: M4-Q23)
Unexpected negative outcomes generate large prediction errors that update internal models and extinguish placebo responses in future encounters.

### What is classical conditioning and what are its phases? (ID: M4-Q24)
Classical conditioning is associative learning where a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) predicts a biologically potent unconditioned stimulus (US). Phases include acquisition (CS paired with US), extinction (CS presented without US, response weakens), and spontaneous recovery (response briefly reappears after a rest period, indicating suppression rather than erasure).
